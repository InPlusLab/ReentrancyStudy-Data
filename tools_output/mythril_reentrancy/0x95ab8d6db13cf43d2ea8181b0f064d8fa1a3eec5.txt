==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Low
Contract: UpdateV3
Function name: transfer(address,address)
PC address: 1202
Estimated Gas Usage: 4358 - 73535
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.

==== Multiple Calls in a Single Transaction ====

Contract: UpdateV3
Function name: transfer(address,address)
PC address: 1331
Estimated Gas Usage: 4358 - 73535
Multiple calls are executed in the same transaction.
This call is executed following another call within the same transaction. It is possible that the call never gets executed if a prior call fails permanently. This might be caused intentionally by a malicious callee. If possible, refactor the code such that each transaction only executes one external call or make sure that all callees can be trusted (i.e. theyâ€™re part of your own codebase).
