The arithmetic operator can overflow.
It is possible to cause an integer overflow or underflow in the arithmetic operation.

veApproval function on the contract you want to be notified. This crafts the function signature manually so one doesn't have to include a contract in here just for this.

        //receiveApproval(address _from, uint256 _value, address _tokenContract, bytes _extraData)

        //it is assumed that when does this that the call *should* succeed, otherwise one would use vanilla approve instead.

        if(!_spender.call(bytes4(bytes32(sha3("receiveApproval(address,uint256,address,bytes)"))), msg.sender, _value, this, _extraData)) { throw; }

        return true;

    }

}

==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107

A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.
