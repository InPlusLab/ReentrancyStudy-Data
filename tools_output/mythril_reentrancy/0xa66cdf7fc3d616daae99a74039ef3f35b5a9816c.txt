==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Low
Contract: MultiSendCoinCrowd
Function name: withdrawTokens(address,uint256)
PC address: 1396
Estimated Gas Usage: 3699 - 39392
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.

==== State access after external call ====

Read of persistent state following external call
The contract account state is accessed after an external call to a user defined address. To prevent reentrancy issues, consider accessing the state only before the call, especially if the callee is untrusted. Alternatively, a reentrancy lock can be used to prevent untrusted callees from re-entering the contract in an intermediate state.
