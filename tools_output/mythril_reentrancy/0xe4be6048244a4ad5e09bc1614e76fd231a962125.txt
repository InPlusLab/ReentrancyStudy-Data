The arithmetic operator can overflow.
It is possible to cause an integer overflow or underflow in the arithmetic operation.

==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107

A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.
