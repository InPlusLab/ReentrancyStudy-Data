SWC ID: 107
Severity: Low
Contract: ReferralTrackerImplV1
Function name: redeemFromGaslessRequest(address,address,address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,address,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)
PC address: 2404
Estimated Gas Usage: 4474 - 40899
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.
