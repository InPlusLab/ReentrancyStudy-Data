The arithmetic operator can overflow.
It is possible to cause an integer overflow or underflow in the arithmetic operation.

spender] = _value;

        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);



        //call the receiveApproval function on the contract you want to be notified. This crafts the function signature manually so one doesn't have to include a contract in here just for this.

        //receiveApproval(address _from, uint256 _value, address _tokenContract, bytes _extraData)

        //it is assumed that when does this that the call *should* succeed, otherwise one would use vanilla approve instead.

==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107

A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.
