/**
 *  This is the Lottery Factory contract, which is used as an intermediate
 *  for deploying new lotteries from the UniLottery main pool.
 *  
 *  This pattern was chosen to avoid the code bloat of the Main Pool
 *  contract - this way, the "new Lottery()" huge bloat statements would
 *  be executed in this Factory, not in the Main Pool.
 *  So, the Main Pool would stay in the 24 kB size limit.
 *
 *  The only drawback, is that 2 contracts would need to be manually
 *  deployed at the start - firstly, this Factory, and secondly, the
 *  Main Pool, passing this Factory instance's address to it's constructor.
 *
 *  The deployment sequence should go like this:
 *  1. Deploy UniLotteryLotteryFactory.
 *  2. Deploy MainUniLotteryPool, passing instance address from step (1)
 *      to it's constructor.
 *  3. [internal operation] MainUniLotteryPool's constructor calls
 *      the initialize() function of the Factory instance it got,
 *      and the Factory instance sets it's pool address and locks it
 *      with initializationFinished boolean.
