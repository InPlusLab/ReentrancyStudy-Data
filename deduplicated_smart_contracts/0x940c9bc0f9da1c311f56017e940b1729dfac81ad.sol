 *
 * @dev Helper contract to support initializer functions. To use it, replace
 * the constructor with a function that has the `initializer` modifier.
 * WARNING: Unlike constructors, initializer functions must be manually
 * invoked. This applies both to deploying an Initializable contract, as well
 * as extending an Initializable contract via inheritance.
 * WARNING: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke
 * a parent initializer twice, or ensure that all initializers are idempotent,
 * because this is not dealt with automatically as with constructors.

/**
 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow
 * checks.
 *
 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
