/**

 * @title TokenSale

 * @dev Distribute tokens to investors in exchange for Ether.

 *

 * This is the primary mechanism for outright sales of commercial investment properties (and blockimmo's STO, where shares

 * of our company are represented as `TokenizedProperty`) (official pending FINMA approval).

 *

 * Selling:

 *   1. Deploy `TokenizedProperty`. Initially all tokens and ownership of this property will be assigned to the 'deployer'

 *   2. Deploy `ShareholderDAO` and transfer the property's (1) ownership to it

 *   3. Configure and deploy a `TokenSale`

 *     - After completing (1, 2, 3) blockimmo will verify the property as legitimate in `LandRegistry`

 *     - blockimmo will then authorize `this` to the `Whitelist` before seller can proceed to (4)

 *   4. Transfer tokens of `TokenizedProperty` (1) to be sold to `this` (3)

 *   5. Investors are able to buy tokens while the sale is open. 'Deployer' calls `finalize` to complete the sale

 *

 * Note: blockimmo will be responsible for managing initial sales on our platform. This means we will be configuring

 *       and deploying all contracts for sellers. This provides an extra layer of control/security until we've refined

 *       these processes and proven them in the real-world.

 *       Later sales will use SplitPayment contracts to route funds, with examples in the tests.

 *

 * Unsold tokens (of a successful sale) are redistributed proportionally to investors via Airdrop, as described in:

 * https://medium.com/FundFantasy/airdropping-vs-burning-part-1-613a9c6ebf1c

 *

 * If a sale's soft-cap is not reached (and the seller does not `accept` a lower price), investors will be refunded Ether and the seller refunded tokens.

 *

 * For stable token sales (soft and hard-cap in USD instead of Wei), we rely on MakerDAO's on-chain ETH/USD conversion rate

 * https://developer.makerdao.com/feeds/

 * This approach to mitigating Ether volatility seems to best when analyzing trade-offs, short of selling directly in FIAT.
