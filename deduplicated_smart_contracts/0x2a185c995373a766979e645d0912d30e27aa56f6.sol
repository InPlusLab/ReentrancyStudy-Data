/* SNAILFARM 3



// SnailFarm 3 is an idlegame in which you buy or sell eggs,

// Which you can hatch into snails, who continuously produce more eggs

// The goal of the game is to reach 1 million snails.

// At that point, you win the round (and the ETH jackpot that comes with it)



// SnailFarm 3 is the latest of a series of iterations over a few months.

// We will attempt to identify the key strengths of each of these iterations

// Focus on refining these features, in order to make for a fun, simple and

// Sustainable experience.



// Shrimpfarm's killer feature: buying and selling eggs directly to the smart contract.

// Snailfarm 1: capturing and holding the Snailmaster position, a ruler collecting dividends.

// Snailfarm 2: juggling with hot potato boosts to increase hatch size.



// SnailFarm 3 in a nutshell:



// The game is played in rounds.

// Buy your starting snails once, play every round at your convenience.

// Player snails are reinitialised at the end of each round.

// Losing players receive "red eggs" as a percentage of their snails.

// Red eggs persist from round to round.

// Red eggs can be hatched as regular eggs for no ETH cost, or used to claim boosts.



// Eggs can be bought and sold directly to the contract.

// No more than 20% of the egg supply can be bought at once.

// On sale, price is divided by 2.



// Hatching eggs into snails come with a slight, fixed, ETH cost.

// The size of a hatch can be improved with special boosts.

// Each boost adds a fixed bonus of an extra full hatch.

// One boost means double hatch. Three boosts means quadruple hatch.

// Two types of boosts exist: hot potato, and personal.



// Hot potato boosts: only one player can hold any of these at a time.

// The price of hot potato boosts rises with each player claim.

// The price of hot potato boosts is reinitialised as the round ends.

// Owners keep hot potato boosts between rounds, until another player claims them.

// SPIDERQUEEN- requires snails. Amount doubles with each claim.

// SQUIRRELDUKE- requires red eggs. Amount doubles with each claim.

// TADPOLEPRINCE- requires ETH. Amount raises by 20% with each claim,

// and the previous owner receives 110% of the ETH he spent.



// Personal boosts: all players can hold them.

// Each personal boost has different rules.



// SLUG- this boost persists between rounds.

// Slug requires a snail sacrifice of at least 100,000 snails.

// It will sacrifice ALL the snails the player own at the moment of the claim.



// LETTUCE- this boost lasts for only one round.

// Lettuce requires red eggs.

// The price of lettuce starts high, and decreases with each lettuce buy.

// The price of lettuce is reinitialised and increases from round to round.



// CARROT- this boost lasts for three rounds in a row.

// Carrot requires ETH.

// The price of carrot is fixed at 0.02 ETH.



// The Snailmaster position as in SnailFarm 1 returns with a twist.

// While still a hot potato, becoming the Snailmaster now requires red eggs.

// That requirement doubles with each claim, and halves between each round.

// Being the Snailmaster persists between rounds.

// The Snailmaster gets a significant cut of every ETH transaction.



// New mechanic: Red Harvest

// The red harvest lets players purchase red eggs for ETH.

// The red harvest works as a dutch auction, similar to cryptokitties.

// Starting price is equal to the current round pot.

// End price is a trivial amount of ETH.

// The auction lasts at most 4 hours.

// Price drops sharply at first, and slower near the end.

// The red harvest contains as many red eggs as the starting snail amount.

// When a player buys the red harvest, a new one is immediately put for sale.



// Bankroll: players can fund the game and receive acorns in exchange.

// Acorns cannot be sold or actively used in any way.

// Acorn holders receive 10% of the ETH invested, proportional to their share.

// Acorns start at half-price to encourage early funding kickstarting the game.

// After that, acorn price slowly decreases from round to round.

// Potential dilution of early holdings encourages refunding the bankroll later on.



// SnailFarm 3 is part of the SnailThrone ecosystem.

// A portion of the ETH spent in SnailFarm 3 is saved as throneDivs.

// SnailThrone holders are rewarded proportionally by throneDivs.



// ETH of every SnailFarm 3 transaction is split as such:

// 50% to the snailPot

// 25% to the eggPot

// 10% to the acorn holders

// 10% to the throneDivs

// 5% to the SnailMaster
