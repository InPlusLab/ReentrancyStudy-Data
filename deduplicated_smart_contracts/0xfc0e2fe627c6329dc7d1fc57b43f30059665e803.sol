Introduction

How it works
Rapid development of projects in the DeFi sector is attracting more and more attention and becomes a constant source of fintech innovation.
Today we are going to review the beta version of a new interesting DeFi service XTRA. The service offers a decentralized functionality for accelerating (boosting) the receipt of COMP tokens from the largest DeFi project Compound, which is almost risk-free and provides an average yield of about 43% per annum.
How it works and what pitfalls there are in the process.
At the end of June 2020 the second-largest DeFi service Compound issued its governments COMP token that is required for participation in the project management and is credited to all Compound users who place funds and receive secured loans.
Let’s have a look at a simple example
You placed funds on the Compound in the amount of 1000 USDC at 3.2% per annum, and you will also receive a certain amount of COMP tokens, which is determined by the size of your share in the sum of all funds placed on the Compound. At the moment the Compound distributes 1445 COMP to everyone per day. If the sum of all funds placed is 10.000.000 USTC, and you have placed 1000 USTC (0.01% of the total amount), then, accordingly, you will receive 0.01% out of all COMP, which equals to 1445 * 0.01% = 0.01445 COMP. The current rate of the COMP token is $134.5, therefore, you will receive an additional $134.5 * 0.01445 = $1.94. If you recalculate $1.94 per day to annual interest, you will additionally get more than 700% per annum.
Indeed, in the early days after token accrual launch, compound users received a very high percentage of the additional profit that exceeded 100%. But since the volume of distributed tokens is fixed, and the size of funds on the Compound exceeds $500,000,000, now the additional average yield from the received COMP tokens does not exceed 6% per annum. That, together with the total balance interest in USDC gives 6% + 3.2% = 9.2% per annum on the dollar balance, which is also a very good result.
But, of course, users always want more and this is possible.
Step 1: let’s place funds in the amount of 1000 USDC and make it a collateral.
Step 2: let’s receive a loan of up to USD $700 (in DAI tokens) on the Compound at a small interest rate, which will give you the opportunity to receive COMP tokens for the amount of the loan taken, according to the scheme that we discussed above using the example of a created balance.
Step 3: let’s create another account on the Compound and place the loan received in DAI inside the new compound account on a balance that will allow you to receive the main 3.2% and an additional ~ 6% interest on it in COMP tokens.
Step 4: again, let’s take a loan for the second balance we created in the amount of up to $490 and get COMP tokens for it as well.
As a result of these steps (you can complete more than 10 of them, as the reasonable number of steps depends on the size of the initial balance), you can increase the total amount of the balance and a loan on the Compound by about 3.2 times, which means that the initial interest of 6% will be increased by 3.2 times.
6% * 3.2 = 19.2%
+ 3.2% on the balance = 22.4%
-4.8% loan repayment = 17.6%
Total: 17.6% per annum on a dollar account. This is just an outstanding result.
What are the risks and specifics?
All these steps will require payment of the Ethereum network commission, and since these are quite complex operations, you will spend from $35 to $60 for 5 to 6 steps. You need to correctly calculate and select tokens for the balance using the average % values for the balance and a loan, otherwise a significant part of the profit can be spent on paying off the high % for the loan. If you take the maximum possible loan amount close to 75% of the balance amount, then in the event of a significant fluctuation in the exchange rate of your chosen tokens or an increase in the loan interest, there is a risk of liquidation of your collateral, which may lead to the loss of 13% of your balance.
We've built a decentralized P2P loan economy on the blockchain.

Traditional loans are inflexible and inaccessible to most people in 2021. DeFi has proven there is a working use-case in decentralizing such financial services.
However, blockchain comes with anonymity and removes trusted third-parties, which limits the types of loans that can be issued. Why? Because some people are more likely to pay back a loan than others.
Trust and reputation still matters when issuing loans.
Xtra Protocol solves this by building an irrefutable, verifiable reputation system onto the blockchain and tying it together with decentralized finance services.
The result is a peer-to-peer loan economy, whereby lenders can trivially repossess collateral via smart contracts.
Now, for the first time, P2P loans can be issued to anyone, regardless of their reputation.
