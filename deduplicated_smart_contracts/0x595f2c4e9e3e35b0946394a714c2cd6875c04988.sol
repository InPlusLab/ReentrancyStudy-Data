// What changed for V2 (June 2020 update):
// - Medium Severity Fixes:
// - Added a check on buy to prevent front-running. Needs to give currentPrice when buying.
// - Removed ability for someone to block buying through revert on ETH send. Funds get sent to a pull location.
// - Added patron check on depositWei. Since anyone can send, it can be front-run, stealing a deposit by buying before deposit clears.
// - Other Minor Changes:
// - Added past foreclosureTime() if it happened in the past.
// - Moved patron modifier checks to AFTER patronage. Thus, not necessary to have steward state anymore.
// - Removed steward state. Only check on price now. If price = zero = foreclosed. 
// - Removed paid mapping. Wasn't used.
// - Moved constructor to a function in case this is used with upgradeable contracts.
// - Changed currentCollected into a view function rather than tracking variable. This fixed a bug where CC would keep growing in between ownerships.
// - Kept the numerator/denominator code (for reference), but removed to save gas costs for 100% patronage rate.

// - Changes for UI:
// - Need to have additional current price when buying.
// - foreclosureTime() will now backdate if past foreclose time.
