YOUR BASTARD, YOUR CALL!!!

AS YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE HOLDER OF A BASTARD (AKA BGAN, OR BGANPUNK), YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH IT.
THIS OFFICIAL SMART CONTRACT EXTENDS IT ONE STEP FURTHER, NOW YOU CAN WRITE YOUR OWN LICENSE FOR YOUR BASTARD!!!

YOU CAN EITHER STORE WHOLE TEXT ON-CHAIN OR POINT TO AN URL (WEBSITE, SERVER, IPFS, ARWEAVE ETC)

I WILL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES ON HOW YOU CAN USE THIS DATA FOR YOUR BASTARD:

YOU CAN WRITE WHICH PERSON/DAO/WHATEVER YOU GIVE PERMISSION TO USE IT FOR SPECIFIC USE CASES
CLAIM THAT THIS BASTARD IS PUBLIC DOMAIN
OR CAN SAY HI TO YOUR FRIENDS & BELOVED ONES
OR USE HERE AS A CANVAS FOR YOUR TEXTS
OR A MEDIUM FOR YOUR CONCEPTUAL PIECE
OR A TEXT SCORE FOR A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE
OR FILL IT WITH YOUR JUNK
OR ASCII COPYPASTA
OR POEM
OR YOUR FAVOURITE BASTARDOUS FOOD RECEIPT
OR BASTARD LORE / ORIGIN STORY YOU MADE UP
OR MORSE CODE
OR AN ULTRA MEGA META SHIT
OR A RIDDLE
OR YOUR NUDES
OR A LOVE LETTER
OR A MATH EQUATION THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING FOREVER
OR YOUR ENCRYPTED MESSAGE THAT NO ONE WILL TRY TO CRACK
ROAST YOUR BASTARD OR FLATTER
CLAIM YOUR BASTARD AS YOUR COUNTRY FLAG
PERFORM A RITUAL
IF YOU WANNA LOCK THE TEXT FOREVER, YOU GOTTA FAREWELL WITH YOUR BASTARD AND TRANSFER THEM TO A WALLET THAT NOBODY OWNS.
IN SHORT
DO WHATEVER YOU SEE FIT
IT IS ACTUALLY A PLAYGROUND. YOU ARE PART OF A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.

LESGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 1 2 3 4

BE COOL WITH PEOPLE REMIXING YOUR BASTARD, SUPPORT CREATIVITY

NEW OWNER SHOULD NOT ASK FOR RETROSPECTIVE CLAIM OR BAN. NEW RULES DEAL WITH THINGS FROM THE MOMENT LICENCE IS UPDATED.
