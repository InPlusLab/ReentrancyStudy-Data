//A BurnableOpenPaymet is instantiated with a specified payer and a commitThreshold.
//The recipient not set when the contract is instantiated.

//The constructor is payable, so the contract can be instantiated with initial funds.
//Anyone can contribute to the payment at any time (the () function is payable).

//All behavior of the contract is directed by the payer, but
//the payer can never directly recover the payment unless he becomes the recipient.

//Anyone can become the recipient by contributing the commitThreshold.
//The recipient cannot change once it&#39;s been set.

//The payer can at any time choose to burn or release to the recipient any amount of funds.
