About WAZIR farm

Yield farming can offer high interest rates, but it is becoming almost impossible for smaller farmers to access.
Tracking & responding to yield farming opportunities can be a full-time job.
Gas costs are increasing, moving in-between farming opportunities is becoming prohibitively expensive.
Wazir Farm addresses this by deploying strategies to move assets between different real-time yield farming opportunities, providing real-time WZR Farmers with funds & insurance as well as maximizing Digital assets & Farm Animal/Crop yield.
Who is a WZR stakeholder?
Any wallet that has staked WZF and harvested WZR , claims & locks it without withdrawing it out of the FARM DeFi platform is stakeholder and is eligible for rewards and voting consensus. (The locked amount is what determines the consensus voting and reward ratio)
HOW TO ACQUIRE PFARM?
Participate in Initial Liquidity Pool Offer by a direct transfer of ETH to Reserve wallet address & get WZR.
Stake WZF tokens & harvest WZR tokens with APY of 4000% plus.
Swap WZR with any supported cryptocurrency on UniSwap, 1inch & Balancer and any swap WZR is listed in future.
Buy from exchanges where WZR is listed… Aside UniSwap and other DEX swaps, we intend to later list on centralized exchanges like; HotBit, Mercatox, P2PB2B, FinexBox, IndoEx & decentralized exchanges like; EtherFlyer, BitCratic, AfroDex and any exchange that lists WZR in future.

2021- the Year of the Metal Ox — is upon us, and it’s time to re-evaluate how the message of Wazir Farm is being delivered.
Yield farming has exploded in popularity over the last few months, but despite this, it’s still a relatively small niche in the wider cryptosphere. The concepts and processes that enable high APYs are complex and murky, so it’s not always easy for newcomers (or even old-hands) to understand what’s going on.
To help with our goal of making yield farming easy and accessible, we are asking our community to come up with a range of marketing materials that will help explain in a clear and concise manner how Wazir Farm works.
We value creativity, clarity and quality!
Things we are particularly interested in are:
Explainer Videos — short videos that explain how WZR works and why it is an important piece of the defi puzzle.
Some ideas to get you started:
•  Noob tutorials explaining how to interact with the site , how to deposit , what is APY/APR etc.
•  What is Wazir Farm
•  Why farm at Wazir Farm?
Gabriel Haines put out a nice video a few months ago, but now it’s a little outdated (defi moves fast), so we need something fresh.
Infographics + Visuals — visual explanations of different process
Things we would like to see:
•  Explanations for the main features of WZR
•  How profit share works (inc. compounding explanation)
•  How different strategies work
•  How emissions work
•  Timelock feature
•  Do Hard Work
•  P/E ratio (with comparison where applicable to other projects?)
 
Gabriel Haines strikes again!
 
Nice one Grimbles!
The creation of top-notch informative material forms Part 1 of the marketing contest. Once this stage has concluded, we will run Part 2, which involves spreading the knowledge to all corners of the cryptosphere!
We welcome and encourage organic marketing efforts spearheaded by our community of hard-working yield farmers. So if you have solid defi knowledge, understand how WZR works, and can communicate this effectively, you will be rewarded for your efforts.

How to Enter?
Simply post a link to your entry on Twitter, using the hashtag WZRinfo AND tag WZR_farm + WZRfarm
If you have any questions, or perhaps are looking for someone to help with design aspects, then we recommend visiting the WZR website, asking around, and maybe even teaming up with farmers who can compliment your skillset. It’s a very friendly place, with lots of big brains and creative individuals  lurking.
We’re looking forward to seeing what y’all come up with!
