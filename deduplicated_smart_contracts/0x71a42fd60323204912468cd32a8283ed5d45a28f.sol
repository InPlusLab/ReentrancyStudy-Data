/* SLUGROAD



Simple Fomo Game with fair scaling.

Slugroad has 3 different tracks: different networks, with different settings.

This is the Ethereum track.



A car drives to hyperspeed.

Speed starts at a min of 100mph and rises to a max 1000mph over 7 days.



Buy Slugs with ETH.

Slugs persist between loops!



Get ETH divs from other Slug buys.

Use your earned ETH to Time Warp, buying Slugs for a cheaper price.



Throw Slugs on the windshield to stop the car (+6 minute timer) and become the Driver.



As the driver, you earn miles according to your speed.

Trade 6000 miles for 1% of the pot.



Once the car reaches hyperspeed, the Driver starts draining the pot.

0.01% is drained every second, up to a maximum of 36% in one hour.



The Driver can jump out of the window at any moment to secure his gains.

Once the Driver jumps out, the car drives freely.

Timer resets to 1 hour.

The wheel goes to the starter, but he gets no reward if the car crosses the finish line.



If someone else throws Slugs before the Driver jumps out, he takes the wheel.

Timer resets to 6 minutes, and the Driver gets nothing!



If the Driver keeps the wheel for one hour in hyperspeed, he gets the full pot.

Then we move to loop 2 immediately, on a 7 days timer.



Slug price: (0.000025 + (loopchest/10000)) / loop

The price of slugs initially rises then lowers through a loop, as the pot is drained.

With each new loop, the price of slugs decrease significantly (cancel out early advantage)



Players can Skip Ahead with the ether they won.

Slug price changes to (0.000025 + (loopchest/10000)) / (loop + 1)

Traveling through time will always be more fruitful than buying.



Pot split:

- 60% divs

- 20% slugBank (reserve pot)

- 10% loopChest (round pot)

- 10% snailthrone
