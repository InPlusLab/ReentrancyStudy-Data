 * 
 * ABOUT
 * This Distributed Application (DAPP) provides private (pseudo-anonymous) transactions on the ETH blockchain.
 * A forensic expert will be able to trace these transaction with some time and effort. If you don't do
 * anything illegal where time and effort will be spend to trace you down this should be providing you enough privacy. 
 * You can create public and private transfers (public: anybody with the password can retrieve, private: only a specific address can retrieve).
 * For private transfers there will be no direct link between safeguarding and retrieving the funds, only an indirect link
 * where a forensic investigator would have to trial and error hashing all retrieved password/address combinations 
 * until he stumbles upon the one you used to safeguard the ETH. The more usage this DAPP gets, the more private it becomes.
