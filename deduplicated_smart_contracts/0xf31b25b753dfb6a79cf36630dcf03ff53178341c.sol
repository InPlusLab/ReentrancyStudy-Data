/**

 * @title LandRegistry

 * @dev A minimal, simple database mapping properties to their on-chain representation (`TokenizedProperty`).

 * The purpose of this contract is not to be official or replace the existing (off-chain) land registry.

 * Its purpose is to map entries in the official registry to their on-chain representation.

 * This mapping / bridging process is enabled by our legal framework, which works in-sync with and relies on this database.

 *

 * `this.landRegistry` is the single source of truth for on-chain properties verified legitimate by blockimmo.

 * Any property not indexed in `this.landRegistry` is NOT verified legitimate by blockimmo.

 *

 * `TokenizedProperty` references `this` to only allow tokens of verified properties to be transferred.

 * Any (unmodified) `TokenizedProperty`'s tokens will be transferable if and only if it is indexed in `this.landRegistry` (otherwise locked).

 *

 * `LandRegistryProxy` enables `this` to be easily and reliably upgraded if absolutely necessary.

 * `LandRegistryProxy` and `this` are controlled by a centralized entity.

 * This centralization provides an extra layer of control / security until our contracts are time and battle tested.

 * We intend to work towards full decentralization in small, precise, confident steps by transferring ownership

 * of these contracts when appropriate and necessary.
