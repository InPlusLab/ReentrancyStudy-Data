/* A small utility contract that sends ether to other addresses by means of 
 * SUICIDE/SELFDESTRUCT. Unlike for a normal send/call, if the receiving address
 * belongs to a contract, the contract&#39;s code is never called; one can
 * forcibly increase a contract&#39;s balance!
 *
 * To send $x to y using this technique, simply call `suicideSend(y)` with a 
 * value of $x.
 *
 *
 * If you&#39;re interested in the implications of this trick, I recommend
 * looking at Jo&#227;o Carvalho&#39;s and Richard Moore&#39;s entries to the first
 * Underhanded Solidity Contest [1]. Anybody writing smart ontracts should be 
 * aware of forced balance increases lest their contracts be vulnerable.
