	// BTC and not register them in ETH creates a possibility for manipulation by the company. Thanks to 
	// paymentsInOtherCurrency however, this threat is leveled.

	// (paymentsInOtherCurrency method). Any user can easily check the incoming transactions in a smart contract 
	// on a daily basis. Any hypothetical tricks on the part of the company can be exposed and panic during the ICO, 
	// simply pointing out the incompatibility of paymentsInOtherCurrency (ie, the amount of ETH + BTC collection) 
	// and the actual transactions in BTC. The company strictly adheres to the described principles of openness.
	
	// The company administrator is required to synchronize paymentsInOtherCurrency every working day (but you
