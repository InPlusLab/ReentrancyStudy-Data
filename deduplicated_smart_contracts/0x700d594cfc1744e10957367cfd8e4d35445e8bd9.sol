        Once upon a time, I, Chuang Chou, dreamt I was a butterfly, 
        fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. 
        I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Chou. 
        Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. 
        Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, 
        or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man. 
        Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction. 
        The transition is called the transformation of material things.*/

        Two, Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers. 
        Three: If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge. 
        Therefore, there are patterns everywhere in nature. 
        Evidence: The cycling of disease epidemics;the wax and wane of caribou populations; 
        sun spot cycles; the rise and fall of the Nile. 
        So, what about the crypto market? 
        The universe of numbers that represents the global economy. 
        Millions of hands at work, billions of minds. 
        A vast network, screaming with life. An organism.
        A natural organism. 
        My hypothesis: Within the crypto market, there is a pattern as well...
