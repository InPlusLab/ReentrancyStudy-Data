/*
Starting when the lines and colors meet the canvas, a work of art is born. From the mind of its creator, an idea take its new form. Allow ourselves to be a witness of a process where art, NFT, and DeFi link together in a platform. A place where users and supporters are allowed to farm and to collect NFT cards that feature their creation.

Kanva embarks on its journey in becoming a way for artists and supporters to utilize their talents and make maximum gain from trading precious NFT collectibles. The NFT and DeFi market are slowly making trends and gaining momentum that its billion-dollar industry is worth every attention it’s gaining now. And, this won’t pass the attention of a group of anonymous team of Artists, Developers, Programmers, and Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts that want artists to be part of this chance to empower their artwork.

By carefully planning in constructing the Kanva concept, NFT’s collection, economic model, and its governance Kanva are now ready to make its mission and vision realize. In becoming a bridge between DeFi and NFT, people can engage in various digital artworks and make gains from it through farming limited NFT. Also, providing the capability to sell these cards to decentralized NFT markets.

Currently, artists around the world have limited ways of making an entry in the Ethereum blockchain, and this problem of accessibility is one of the things Kanva wants to answer. Kanva will be an artist platform in bridging their precious artwork into NFT and DeFi. This seeming integration is crucial in making sure that we redefine how arts should be bought and sold. Furthermore, it also aims to facilitate redesigning the traditional concept of art bidding to blockchain-based, decentralized finance using Non-Fungible Token integration.

And now, as we move in this mission of bridging the value of art through DeFi, we are excited to have you as our supporter. Together we are going to create a community where every member is valued and treated with high importance. As we move, we will give you an update on the progress of this project.

Today is the start of this journey and the start of the line and initial colors of a picture we are trying to create, a new and energizing platform called KANVA.

KANVA is a platform based on Ethereum blockchain established to be the intermediary between traditional digital arts and NFT by transforming these digital arts into valuable cards through decentralized finance using NFT. 

By this, KANVA will be true to its mission of empowering artists and the crypto community in bringing the value of art through decentralized finance.

How was KANVA able to achieve this?

KANVA will achieve this by its economic model, better known as tokenomics. First, KANVA Tokenomics will begin by issuing its token, KANVA (KNV). KNV will run natively on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC20, and by this transaction and exchanges in the platform will be easier and convenient.

At the start of the project, KANVA will release 48,000 KNV that will be divided into the following: 40% (19,200 KNV) for Token Sale, 13% (6,240 KNV) to be used in UNISWAP Initial Liquidity, 27% (12,960 KNV) for Ecosystem Fund which will be used for Liquidity Farming in the platform, a 7% (3,360 KNV) Future Development allocation, another 3% (1,440 KNV) allocation that will be utilized for Partnership (3 months lock, and the remaining released monthly for one (1) year after). 

Lastly, 10% (4,800 KNV) are going to the Team that is three (3) months lock, and the remaining released monthly for one (1) year after. These allocations ensure the community that every token is fairly allocated and will give the platform integrity and worthy of the trust of its supporters.
