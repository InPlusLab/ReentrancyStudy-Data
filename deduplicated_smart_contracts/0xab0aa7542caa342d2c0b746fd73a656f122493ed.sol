/*
This is the DevCash Token Contract

DevCash Implements the EIP20 token standard: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20

DevCash will be distributed through bounties at "Blockchain Developers United" and affiliated meetups

Devcash is intended to incentivize proper Blockchain developer training, grant access to developer resources, and act a medium of exchange in the developer marketplace

DevCash is cash for the developer economy

The smart contract code can be viewed here: https://github.com/BlockchainDevelopersUnited/DevCash-ERC20
