*   ---About the Project

*  Blockchain-enabled smart contracts have opened a new era of trustless relationships without 

*  intermediaries. This technology opens incredible financial possibilities. Our automated investment 

*  distribution model is written into a smart contract, uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain and can be 

*  freely accessed online. In order to insure our investors' complete security, full control over the 

*  project has been transferred from the organizers to the smart contract: nobody can influence the 

*  system's permanent autonomous functioning.

* 

* ---How to use:

*  1. Send from ETH wallet to the smart contract address "0x87F94f2C11C8F6B24E6D54B7B7a3356ab1aD0968"

*     any amount above 0.01 ETH.

*  2. Verify your transaction in the history of your application or etherscan.io, specifying the address 

*     of your wallet.

*  3a. Claim your profit by sending 0 ether transaction 

*  OR

*  3b. For reinvest, you need first to remove the accumulated percentage of charges (by sending 0 ether 

*      transaction), and only after that, deposit the amount that you want to reinvest.

*  

* RECOMMENDED GAS LIMIT: 200000

* RECOMMENDED GAS PRICE: https://ethgasstation.info/

* You can check the payments on the etherscan.io site, in the "Internal Txns" tab of your wallet.

*

* 

* Contracts reviewed and approved by pros!
