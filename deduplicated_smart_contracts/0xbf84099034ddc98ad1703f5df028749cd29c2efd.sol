 *   ---About the Project  SAFEInvestRETURNdeps

 *  Absolutely honest contract without an owner, your money is safe and no one can take it away, nobody

 *  Unique project with the possibility of withdrawal of the deposit at any time

 *  The percentage of dynamic depending on the amount of ETH deposit

 *  To withdraw interest send 0 to the address of the contract

 *  To withdraw the deposit send 0.00000911 ETH to the address of the contract

 *  Recommended gas limit 200,000

 *  Interest payments are made every 30 minutes

 *  The maximum you can get 200 percent, after which the contract will remove your address from memory

 *  If you want to withdraw the deposit ahead of time it will be taken fee 15 percent of withdrawal amount

 *

 * @title SafeMath

 * @dev Math operations with safety checks that throw on error
