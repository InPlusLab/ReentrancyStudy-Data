// GoldFarm is a cross-chain DeFi FaaS protocol that allows users to deploy crypto and NFT farms on BSC and ETH with no code required!
// 1,000,000 $GOLD tokens will be minted and split between BSC and ETH blockchains. 
// 1,000,000 $GOLD will be the max supply and the initial circulating supply will be 900,000 $GOLD.
// GoldFarm is a cross-chain DeFi protocol designed to bring utility to any token by turning it into an NFT farm with no code required on 
// both BSC and ETH blockchains. With an innovative suite of visual tools, any project can deploy the world's most exciting new farm 
// with custom rules that incentivize the behaviors they value most. It's easy to reward liquidity providers, incentivize longer stakes 
// or even provide special access to your project's services through NFTs with utility.

// GoldFarm provides a bridge between current crypto ecosystems and the explosive gaming industry. 
// NFTs from GoldFarm and Official Partner Farms will gain utility within real AAA video games, 
// in this ecosystem, NFTs are no longer just pixels on a screen, but hold the power to unlock unique digital experiences.
