Just for buying Rocket Bunny and holding it in your wallet, you will earn passive income that is deposited
directly into your wallet via frictionless yield on all transactions of Rocket Bunny.No staking required!

Rocket Bunny combines the most sought after tokenomics across DeFi: automatic liquidity adds, 
compounding yield, deflationary supply, liquidity provider rewards, and price shock protection.

Rocket Bunny is a deflationary token with a max circulating supply of 777 Quadrilion. Each transaction 
incurs a 4% tax that is distributed in four equal parts: 1% to holders, 1% burned to The Rabbit's Hole, 
1% locked liquidity, and 1% as a bonus to liquidity providers. As volume increases, the amount burned 
increases logarithmically, eventually leading to an exponential decrease in supply.

The Rabbit Hole burns do not stop, the instant holder rewards do not stop, the 2x rewards for liquidity 
providers do not stop, and the locked liquidity adds do not stop. This means the Rocket Bunny supply will 
become more scarce, your holdings will continue to increase, particularly if you are a liquidty provider 
earning 2x rewards, and the price floor for Rocket Bunny will continue to rise.

- Deflationary supply
- Rewards directly into your wallet
- 2x rewards for LP
- Automatic & locked liquidity adds
- Whale dump protection
