    // This is the main LoveBank contract. The function of our DApp is quite straight forward:
    //  to create a account for couple, which is displayed on our website. Owers can put money in 
    //  as well as strangers. Withdraw request can only be done with both owners permission.
    //  In honor of eternal love, the party who puts forward a breakup will transfer all the remain
    //  balance to the other party by default.
    // 
    //  To make the contract more logical, we simple seperate our contract in following parts:
    //
    //      - LoveBankAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for 
    //             operations that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.
    //
    //      - Bank is LoveBankAccessControl: In this contract we define the main stucture of our 
    //              Love Bank and the methord to create accounts. Also, all the operations of users are
    //              defined here, like money withdraw, breakup, diary, milestones. Lots of modifiers
    //              are used to protect user&#39;s safety.
    //
    //      - LovePromo is Bank: Here are some simple operations for COO to set free-charge time and for CEO
    //              to lower the charge rate.
    //
    //      - BankCore is LovePromo: inherit all previous contract. Contains all the big moves, like: 
    //              creating a bank, set defult C-Level users, unpause, update (only when hugh bug happens),
    //              withdraw money, etc.
    //
    //      - LoveAccountBase: This contract is the contract of a love account. Holds all common structs,
    //              events and base variables for love accounts.
