     * @dev Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting

     *
     * Calling conditions:
     *
     * - When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, ``from``'s `tokenId` will be
     * transferred to `to`.
     * - When `from` is zero, `tokenId` will be minted for `to`.
     * - When `to` is zero, ``from``'s `tokenId` will be burned.
     * - `from` and `to` are never both zero.
     *
     * To learn more about hooks, head to xref:ROOT:extending-contracts.adoc#using-hooks[Using Hooks].
