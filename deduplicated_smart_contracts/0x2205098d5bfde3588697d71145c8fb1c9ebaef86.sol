// Our Aetherian #0 ownership is now handled by this contract instead of our core. This contract "owns" 
// the monster and players can bid to get their hands on this mystical creature until someone else outbids them.
// Every following sale increases the price by x1.5 until no one is willing to outbid the current owner.
// Once a player has lost ownership, they will get a full refund of their bid + 50% of the revenue created by the sale.
// The other 50% go to the dev team to fund development. 
// This "hot potato" style auction technically never ends and enables some very interesting scenarios
// for our in-game world
