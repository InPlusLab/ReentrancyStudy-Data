 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @title Contract for grantable ERC20 token vesting schedules
 *
 * @notice Adds to an ERC20 support for grantor wallets, which are able to grant vesting tokens to
 *   beneficiary wallets, following per-wallet custom vesting schedules.
 *
 * @dev Contract which gives subclass contracts the ability to act as a pool of funds for allocating
 *   tokens to any number of other addresses. Token grants support the ability to vest over time in
 *   accordance a predefined vesting schedule. A given wallet can receive no more than one token grant.
 *
 *   Tokens are transferred from the pool to the recipient at the time of grant, but the recipient
 *   will only able to transfer tokens out of their wallet after they have vested. Transfers of non-
 *   vested tokens are prevented.
 *
 *   Two types of toke grants are supported:
 *   - Irrevocable grants, intended for use in cases when vesting tokens have been issued in exchange
 *     for value, such as with tokens that have been purchased in an ICO.
 *   - Revocable grants, intended for use in cases when vesting tokens have been gifted to the holder,
 *     such as with employee grants that are given as compensation.
