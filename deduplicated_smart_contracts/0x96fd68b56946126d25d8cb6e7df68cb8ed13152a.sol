Author: Vox / 0xPool.io
Description: This smart contract is designed to store mining pool payouts for 
  Ethereum Protocol tokens and allow pool miners to withdraw their earned tokens
  whenever they please. There are several benefits to using a smart contract to
  track mining pool payouts:
    - Increased transparency on behalf of pool owners
    - Allows users more control over the regularity of their mining payouts
    - The pool admin does not need to pay the gas costs of hundreds of 
      micro-transactions every time a block reward is found by the pool.

This contract is the 0xBTC (0xBitcoin) payout account for: http://0xpool.io
