//This contract is backed by the constitution of superDAO deployed at : .
//The constitution of the superDAO is the social contract, terms, founding principles and definitions of the vision,
//mission, anti-missions, rules and operation guidelines of superDAO.
//The total number of 3,000,000 represents 3% of 100,000,000 immutable number of superDAO tokens,
//which is the alloted budget of operation for the earliest funding activities.
//Every prommissory token is exchangeable for the real superDAO tokens on a one on one basis.
//Promissiory contract will be deployed with the actual superDAO token contract.
//Early backers can call the "redeem" function on the actual token contract to exchange promissory tokens for the final tokens.
