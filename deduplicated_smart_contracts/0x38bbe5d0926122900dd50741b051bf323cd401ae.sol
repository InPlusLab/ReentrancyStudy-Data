  Allows owner/seller to deposit ETH in order to participate in
  an ICO on behalf of the contract so that users can buy directly
  from this contract with assurances that they will receive their
  tokens via a user-invoked withdrawal() call once the ICO token
  creator releases tokens for trading.

  This affords users the ability to reserve/claim tokens that they
  were not able to buy in an ICO, before they hit the exchanges.
