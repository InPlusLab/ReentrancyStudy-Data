* -> What?
Due to a weakness in Etherscan.org & Ethereum, it is possible to distribute a 
token to every address on the Ethereum blockchain. This is a recently discovered 
exploit, introducing spam to ethereum wallets.

If you see this, chances are you've already seen others, the more apparant this 
becomes to the Ethereum and Etherscan developers the better.

NOTICE: Attempting to transfer this spam token *WILL NOT WORK* 
        DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRADE.

* -> Why?
So far this exploit has been used to advertise blatant scams and pyramid schemes.

This contract wishes to advertise BlueDEX to you, a decentralized exchange for your ERC20 tokens.
