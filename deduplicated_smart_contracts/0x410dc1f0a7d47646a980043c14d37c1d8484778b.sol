     *This is an extreme deflation project. 
     *The project team is composed of four highly capable programmers and three geniuses in the marketing world.
     *The project party has the confidence and ability to increase the value of the tokens in a short period of time;
     *The short-term goal is to achieve a 1,000% increase in the issue price within two weeks and a 1,000-fold increase within three months;
     *The long-term goal is to achieve a value increase of more than 10,000 times within a year, let us look forward to it together.

     *Automatically Deflation 10% per transaction
     * 4% of them are transferred to the black hole and destroyed permanently
     * 4% as a dividend for the address holding the token
     * 2% automatically returns to the fluidity pool
