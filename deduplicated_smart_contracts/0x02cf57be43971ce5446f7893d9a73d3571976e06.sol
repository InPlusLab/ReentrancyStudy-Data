// Aethia CHI sell contract. Not affiliated with the game developers. Use at your own risk.
//
// BUYERS: to protect against scams:
// 1) check the price by clicking on "Read smart contract" in etherscan. Two prices are published
//     a) price for 1 Chi in wei (1 wei = 10^-18 ETH), and b) number of Chi you get for 1 ETH
// 2) Make sure you use high enough gas price that your TX confirms within 1 hour, to avoid the scam
//    detailed below*
// 3) Check the hardcoded Chi address below givet to ChiToken() constructor. Make sure this is the real Chi
//    token. Scammers could clone this contract and modify the address to sell you fake tokens.
//
//
// This contract enables trustless exchange of Chi tokens for ETH.
// Anyone can use this contract to sell Chi, as long as it is in an empty state.
// Contract is in an empty state if it has no CHI or ETH in it and is not in cooldown
// The main idea behind the contract is to keep it very simple to use, especially for buyers.
// Sellers need to set allowance and call the setup() function using MEW, which is a little more involved.
// Buyers can use Metamask to send and receive Chi tokens.
//
// You are welcome to clone this contract as much as you want, as long as you dont&#39; try to scam anyone.
//
// To use the contract:
// 1) Call approve on the Chi ERC20 address for this contract. That will allow the contract
//    to hold your Chi tokens in escrow. You can always withdraw you Chi tokens back.
//    You can make this call using MEW. The Chi contract address and ABI are available here:
//    https://etherscan.io/address/0x71e1f8e809dc8911fcac95043bc94929a36505a5#code
// 2) Call setup(chi_amount, price) on this contract, for example by using MEW.
//    This call will take your tokens and hold them in escrow, while at the same time
//    you get the ownership of the contract. While you own the contract (i.e. while the contract
//    holds your tokens or your ETH, nobody else can call setup(). If they do, the call will fail.
//    If you call approve() on the Chi contract, but someone else calls setup() on this contract
//    nothing bad happens. You can either wait for this contract to go into empty state, or find
//    another contract (or publish your own). You will need to call approve() again for the new contract.
// 3) Advertise the contract address so others can buy Chi from it. Buying Chi is simple, the
//    buyer needs to send ETH to the contract address, and the contract sends them CHI. The buyer
//    can verify the price by viewing the contract.
// 4) To claim your funds back (both Chi and ETH resulting from any sales), simply send 0 ETH to
//    the contract. The contract will send you ETH and Chi back, and reset the contract for others to use.
//
// *) There is a cooldown period of 1 hour after the contract is reset, before it can be used again.
//    This is to avoid possible scams where the seller sees a pending TX on the contract, then resets
//    the contract and call setup() is a much higher price. If the seller does that with very high gas price,
//    they could change the price for the buyer&#39;s pending TX. A cooldown of 1 hour prevents this attac, as long
//    as the buyer&#39;s TX confirms within the hour.
