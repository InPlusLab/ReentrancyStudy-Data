/**
 *  StickerRegistry
 *
 *  This is a simple contract to implement a demo of a collectible blockchain
 *  item.
 *
 *  As part of the Firefly Crowdsale, backers and participants of various events
 *  will receive limited edition Firefly stickers. Each sticker is procedurally
 *  generated and unique. The ownership of the sticker is tracked by an instance
 *  of this contract.
 *
 *  Since many people will likely not care about the actual sticker, ownership
 *  and all that jazz, this has been designed to be very gas effecient from the
 *  project owner&#39;s point of view.
 *
 *  When a new series is minted, the entire series manifest is made public, along with
 *  a list of faux owners. Each faux owner is an address, for which there exists a
 *  secret, which can be used to generate a private key and claim the sticker by
 *  signing a message (the destination address) and calling this contract.
 *
 *  All the faux owners along with their sticker serial number are used to create a
 *  merkle tree, of which only the merkle root is registered with the set.
 *
 *  Nomenclature
 *   - Serial Number:  1-indexed (human ordinal) index into the list of items/redeem codes
 *   - item index:     0-indexed (mchine ordinal) representation of the Serial Number
 */

/**
 *  Why use ENS?
 *   - Enforces series name uniqueness
 *   - Offloads series ownership and name collision disputes
 *   - Hierarchical (e.g. weatherlight.mtg.wotc.eth)
 *   - Strong authenticity and identity
 *   - Prevents spam
 *   - A well-adopted standard that will be maintained and extended
