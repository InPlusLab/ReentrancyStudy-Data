      Main mechanism to ensure a buyer&#39;s purchase/ETH/IOU is safe.

      Refund the buyer&#39;s ETH if we&#39;re beyond the date of our distribution
      promise AND if the contract doesn&#39;t have an adequate amount of tokens
      to distribute to the buyer. If we&#39;re beyond the given date, yet there
      is an adequate amount of tokens in the contract&#39;s balance, then the
      buyer can withdraw accordingly. This allows buyers to withdraw well
      into the future if they need to. It also allows us to extend the sale.
      Time-sensitive ETH protection is only applicable if the contract
      doesn&#39;t have adequate tokens for the buyer.

      The "adequacy" check prevents the seller and/or third party attacker
      from locking down buyers&#39; ETH. i.e. The attacker sends 1 token into our
      contract to falsely signal that the contract has been filled and is ready
      for token distribution. If we simply check for a >0 token balance, we risk
      distribution errors AND stranding/locking the buyer&#39;s ETH.
