`RegBase` provides an inheriting contract the minimal API to be compliant with 
`Registrar`.  It includes a set-once, `bytes32 public regName` which is refered
to by `Registrar` lookups.

An owner updatable `address public owner` state variable is also provided and is
required by `Factory.createNew()`.

This file is part of the SandalStraps framework

Factories are a core but independant concept of the SandalStraps framework and 
can be used to create SandalStraps compliant &#39;product&#39; contracts from embed
bytecode.

The abstract Factory contract is to be used as a SandalStraps compliant base for
product specific factories which must impliment the createNew() function.

is itself compliant with `Registrar` by inhereting `RegBase` and
compiant with `Factory` through the `createNew(bytes32 _name, address _owner)`
API.

An optional creation fee can be set and manually collected by the owner.
