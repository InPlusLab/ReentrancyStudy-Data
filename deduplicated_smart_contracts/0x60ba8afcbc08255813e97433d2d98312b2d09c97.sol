/*
A generic issued EC20 standard token, that can be issued by an issuer which the owner
of the contract sets. The issuer can only be set once if the onlyOnce option is true.
There is a freezePeriod option on transfers, if need be. There is also an date of
last issuance setting, if set, no more tokens can be issued past that time.

The token uses the a standard token API as much as possible, and overrides the transfer
and transferFrom methods. This way, we dont need special API&#39;s to issue this token.
We can retain the original StandardToken api, but add additional features.

Upon construction, initial token holders can be specified with their values.
Two arrays must be used. One with the token holer addresses, the other with the token
holder balances. They must be aligned by array index.
