*
* -> Another Contract????
* In short, this is a contract to accept RAMEN token / ETH donations from community members
* as a way of gathering funds for regular marketing, contest and helping to fight hunger.
* [✓] Hands of Titanium! This contract never sells, it can't and just simply don't know how to sell!
* [✓] Community Goods: All rewards will be used for promotional costs / contest prizes and our initiative to fight hunger, when the accumulated rewards reaches a certain amount, we'll begin some campaigns.
