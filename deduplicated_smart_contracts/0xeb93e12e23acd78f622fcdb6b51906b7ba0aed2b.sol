/* SNAILFARM 2

// We keep the same basics as SnailFarm: hatch eggs into snails, buy or sell eggs for money.
// Hatching now comes with a small ETH cost.
// Your snails don't die anymore when you sell eggs.
// Referrals are gone.
// The formula for buying and selling eggs is simplified.
// Only a finite number of eggs is available for sale.
// This number is based on initial seed, and varies based on player buys and sells.
// Eggs sell for half of the current buy price.
// There is no more extra inflation tied to hatching.

// The ultimate goal of the game is the Snailmaster title.
// The reward is now a lump sum rather than a constant fee.
// To become Snailmaster, you need a certain number of snails.
// Once you take the Snailmaster title, you lose 90% of your snails.
// 20% of the snailpot is immediately paid out to the Snailmaster.
// When someone becomes the Snailmaster, a new round starts.
// The amount of snails required to claim the title increases with each new round.
// The amount of starting snails also increases by that same amount for new players.

// We introduce a new mechanic: the Ethertree.
// Every ETH added to the contract is split 50/50 between the snailpot and the treepot.
// Players can claim ETH from the ethertree through selling acorns.
// Players can buy acorns for twice their current price.
// (Half of the ETH goes in the snailpot, half of the ETH buys acorns at their going rate.)
// Players get a better rate on acorn buys if the current snailpot is under the previous snailpot.
// The price of acorns can only rise over time.

// We add three hot potato items: the SpiderQueen, the TadpolePrince, and the SquirrelDuke.
// Owning any of these boosts adds base hatch size to your hatch, cumulative.
// (With 2 boosts, you get 1+1+1 = 3 times the snails when you hatch your eggs.)
// The Tadpole Prince costs ETH, and rises by 20% with every buy.
// 10% goes to the previous holder, 5% goes to the snailpot, 5% to the treepot.
// The Spider Queen costs snails, this cost doubles with every buy.
// The Squirrel Duke costs acorns, this cost doubles with every buy.
