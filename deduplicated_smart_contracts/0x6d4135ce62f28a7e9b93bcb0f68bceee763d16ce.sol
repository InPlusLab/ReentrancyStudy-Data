/* SNAILNUMBER



Simple game contract to let players pick a magic number.

The number has no importance in itself, but will be used in another game!



Players must bid higher than the previous bid to enter their number.

Whoever has the highest bid at the end of a 24 hours period wins.

The winner gets a share of all the ETH, based on how quickly he bid.

The rest of the ETH is sent to SnailThrone as divs.
