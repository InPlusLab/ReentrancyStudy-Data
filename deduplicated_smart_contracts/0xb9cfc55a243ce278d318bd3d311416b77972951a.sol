/**
 *  Simple, gas-efficient lottery, which uses Uniswap as liquidity provider,
 *  and determines the lottery winners through a 3 different approaches
 *  (explained in detail on EndingAlgoType documentation).
 *
 *  This contract contains all code of the lottery contract, and 
 *  lotteries themselves are just storage-container stubs, which use
 *  DelegateCall mechanism to execute this actual lottery code on
 *  their behalf.
 *
 *  Lottery workflow consists of these consecutive stages:
 *
 *  1. Initialization stage: Main Pool deploys this lottery contract,
 *      and calls initialize() with initial Ether funds provided.
 *      Lottery mints initial token supply and provides the liquidity
 *      to Uniswap, with whole token supply and initial Ether funds.
 *      Then, lottery becomes Active - trading tokens becomes allowed.
 *
 *  2. Active Stage:    Token transfers occurs on this stage, and 
 *      finish probability is Zero. Our ETH funds in Uniswap increases
 *      in this stage.
 *      When certain criteria of holder count and fund gains are met,
 *      the Finishing stage begins.
 *  
 *  3. Finishing Stage:     It can be considered a second part of
 *      an Active stage, because all token transfers and Uniswap trading
 *      are still allowed and occur actively.
 *      However, on this stage, for every transfer, a pseudo-random
 *      number is rolled, and if that rolled number is below a specific
 *      threshold, lottery de-activates, and Ending stage begins, when
 *      token transfers are denied.
 *      The threshold is determined by Finish Probability, which
 *      increases on every transfer on this stage.
 *
 *      However, notice that if Finishing Criteria (holder count and
 *      fund gains) are no-longer met, Finishing Stage pauses, and
 *      we get back to Active Stage.
 *
 *  4. Ending-Mining Stage - Step One:
 *      On this stage, we Remove our contract's liquidity share
 *      from Uniswap, then transfer the profits to the Pool and
 *      the Owner addresses.
 *
 *      Then, we call the Randomness Provider, requesting the Random Seed,
 *      which later should be passed to us by calling our callback
 *      (finish_randomnessProviderCallback).
 *
 *      Miner, who completes this step, gets portion of Mining Rewards,
 *      which are a dedicated profit share to miners.
 *
 *  5. Ending-Mining Stage - Step Two:  On this stage, if  *
 *      However, if Randomness Provider hasn't given us a seed after
 *      specific amount of time, on this step, before starting the
 *      Winner Selection Algorithm, an Alternative Seed Generation
 *      is performed, where the pseudo-random seed is generated based
 *      on data in our and Storage contracts (transfer hash, etc.).
 *
 *      If we're using MinedWinnerSelection ending algorithm type, then
 *      on this step the miner performs the gas-intensive Winner Selection 
 *      Algorithm, which involves complex score calculations in a loop, and
 *      then sorting the selected winners array.
 *
 *      Miner who successfully completes this step, gets a portion of
 *      the Mining Rewards.
 *
 *  6. Completion Stage (Winner Prize Claiming stage):  On this stage,
 *      the Lottery Winners can finally claim their Lottery Prizes,
 *      by calling a prize claim function on our contract.
 *
 *      If we're using WinnerSelfValidation ending algorithm, winner
 *      computes and validates his final score on this function by
 *      himself, so the prize claim transaction can be gas-costly.
 *
 *      However, is RolledRandomness or MinedWinnerSelection algorithms
 *      are used, this function is cheap in terms of gas.
 *
 *      However, if some of winners fail to claim their prizes after
 *      a specific amount of time (specified in config), then those
 *      prizes can then be claimed by Lottery Main Pool too.

        // 1. Mined Winner Selection Algorithm.
        //  This algorithm is executed by a Lottery Miner in a single
        //  transaction, on Mining Step 2.
        //
        //  On that single transaction, all ending scores for all
        //  holders are computed, and a sorted winner array is formed,
        //  which is written onto the LotteryStorage state.
        //  Thus, it's gas expensive, and suitable only for small
        //  holder numbers (up to 300).
        //
        // Pros:
        //  + Guaranteed deterministically specifiable winner prize
        //    distribution - for example, if we specify that there
        //    must be 2 winners, of which first gets 60% of prize funds,
        //    and second gets 40% of prize funds, then it's
        //    guarateed that prize funds will be distributed just
        //    like that.
        //
        //  + Low gas cost of prize claims - only ~ 40,000 gas for
        //    claiming a prize.
        //
        // Cons:
        //  - Not scaleable - as the Winner Selection Algorithm is
        //    executed in a single transaction, it's limited by 
        //    block gas limit - 12,500,000 on the MainNet.
        //    Thus, the lottery is limited to ~300 holders, and
        //    max. ~200 winners of those holders.
        //    So, it's suitable for only express-lotteries, where
        //    a lottery runs only until ~300 holders are reached.
        //
        //  - High mining costs - if lottery has 300 holders,
        //    mining transaction takes up whole block gas limit.
        //
        MinedWinnerSelection,

        // 2. Winner Self-Validation Algorithm.
        //
        //  This algorithm does no operations during the Mining Stage
        //  (except for setting up a Random Seed in Lottery Storage) -
        //  the winner selection (obtaining a winner rank) is done by
        //  the winners themselves, when calling the prize claim
        //  functions.
        //
        //  This algorithm relies on a fact that by the time that
        //  random seed is obtained, all data needed for winner selection
        //  is already there - the holder scores of the Active Stage
        //  (ether contributed, time factors, token balance), and
        //  the Random Data (random seed + nonce (holder's address)),
        //  so, there is no need to compute and sort the scores for the
        //  whole holder array.
        //
        //  It's done like this: the holder checks if he's a winner, using
        //  a view-function off-chain, and if so, he calls the 
        //  claimWinnerPrize() function, which obtains his winner rank
        //  on O(n) time, and does no writing to contract states,
        //  except for prize transfer-related operations.
        //
        //  When computing the winner's rank on LotteryStorage,
        //  O(n) time is needed, as we loop through the holders array,
        //  computing ending scores for each holder, using already-known
        //  data. 
        //  However that means that for every prize claim, all scores of
        //  all holders must be re-computed.
        //  Computing a score for a single holder takes roughly 1500 gas
        //  (400 for 3 slots SLOAD, and ~300 for arithmetic operations).
        //
        //  So, this algorithm makes prize claims more expensive for
        //  every lottery holder.
        //  If there's 1000 holders, prize claim takes up 1,500,000 gas,
        //  so, this algorithm is not suitable for small prizes,
        //  because gas fee would be higher than the prize amount won.
        //
        // Pros:
        //  + Guaranteed deterministically specifiable winner prize
        //    distribution (same as for algorithm 1).
        //
        //  + No mining costs for winner selection algorithm.
        //
        //  + More scalable than algorithm 1.
        //
        // Cons:
        //  - High gas costs of prize claiming, rising with the number
        //    of lottery holders - 1500 for every lottery holder.
        //    Thus, suitable for only large prize amounts.
        //
        WinnerSelfValidation,

        // 3. Rolled-Randomness algorithm.
        //
        //  This algorithm is the most cheapest in terms of gas, but
        //  the winner prize distribution is non-deterministic.
        //
        //  This algorithm doesn't employ miners (no mining costs),
        //  and doesn't require to compute scores for every holder
        //  prior to getting a winner's rank, thus is the most scalable.
        //
        //  It works like this: a holder checks his winner status by
        //  computing only his own randomized score (rolling a random
        //  number from the random seed, and multiplying it by holder's
        //  Active Stage score), and computing this randomized-score's
        //  ratio relative to maximum available randomized score.
        //  The higher the ratio, the higher the winner rank is.
        //
        //  However, many players can roll very high or low scores, and
        //  get the same prizes, so it's difficult to make a fair and
        //  efficient deterministic prize distribution mechanism, so
        //  we have to fallback to specific heuristic workarounds.
        //
        // Pros:
        //  + Scalable: O(1) complexity for computing a winner rank,
        //      so there can be an unlimited amount of lottery holders,
        //      and gas costs for winner selection and prize claim would
        //      still be constant & low.
        //
        //  + Gas-efficient: gas costs for all winner-related operations
        //      are constant and low, because only single holder's score
        //      is computed.
        //
        //  + Doesn't require mining - even more gas savings.
        //
        // Cons:
        //  + Hard to make a deterministic and fair prize distribution
        //      mechanism, because of un-known environment - as only
        //      single holder's score is compared to max-available
        //      random score, not taking into account other holder
        //      scores.

     *  Mining function, to be executed on Ending (Mining) stage.
     *
     *  "Mining" approach is used in this lottery, to use external
     *  actors for executing the gas-expensive Ending Algorithm,
     *  and other ending operations, such as profit transfers.
     *
     *  "Miners" can be any external actors who call this function.
     *  When Miner successfully completes a Mining Step, he gets 
     *  a Mining Reward, which is a certain portion of lottery's profit
     *  share, dedicated to Miners.
     *
     *  NOT-IMPLEMENTED APPROACH:
     *
     *  All these operations are divided into "mining steps", which are
     *  smaller components, which fit into reasonable gas limits.
     *  All "steps" are designed to take up similar amount of gas.
     *
     *  For example, if total lottery profits (total ETH got from
     *  pulling liquidity out of Uniswap, minus initial funds),
     *  is 100 ETH, Miner Profit Share is 10%, and there are 5 mining
     *  steps total, then for a singe step executed, miner will get:
     *
     *  (100 * 0.1) / 5 = 2 ETH.
     *
     *  ---------------------------------
     *
     *  CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED APPROACH:
     *
     *  As the above-defined approach would consume very much gas for
     *  inter-step intermediate state storage, we have thought that
     *  for now, it's better to have only 2 mining steps, the second of
     *  which performs the whole Winner Selection Algorithm.
     *
     *  This is because performing the whole algorithm at once would save
     *  us up to 10x more gas in total, than executing it in steps.
     *
     *  However, this solution is not scalable, because algorithm has
     *  to fit into block gas limit (10,000,000 gas), so we are limited
     *  to a certain safe maximum number of token holders, which is
     *  empirically determined during testing, and defined in the
     *  MAX_SAFE_NUMBER_OF_HOLDERS constant, which is checked against the
     *  config value "finishCriteria_minNumberOfHolders" in constructor.
     *
     *  So, in this approach, there are only 2 mining steps:
     *
     *  1. Remove liquidity from Uniswap, transfer profit shares to
     *      the Pool and the Owner Address, and request Random Seed
     *      from the Randomness Provider.
     *      Reward: 25% of total Mining Rewards.
     *
     *  2. Perform the whole Winner Selection Algorithm inside the
     *      Lottery Storage contract.
     *      Reward: 75% of total Mining Rewards.
     *
     *  * Function transfers Ether out of our contract:
     *    - Transfers the current miner's reward to msg.sender.
