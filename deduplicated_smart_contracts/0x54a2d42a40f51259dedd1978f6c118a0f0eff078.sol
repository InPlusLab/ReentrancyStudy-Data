	 * The formula for the price over time.
	 *
	 * This is a hand-crafted formula (no named to the constants) in order to
	 * provide the following requirements:
	 *
	 * - Simple reciprocal curve (of the form y = a + b / (x + c));
	 * - Would be completely unreasonable to end in the first 48 hours;
	 * - Would reach $65m effective cap in 4 weeks.
	 *
	 * The curve begins with an effective cap (EC) of over $30b, more ether
	 * than is in existance. After 48 hours, the EC reduces to approx. $1b.
	 * At just over 10 days, the EC has reduced to $200m, and half way through
	 * the 19th day it has reduced to $100m.
	 *
