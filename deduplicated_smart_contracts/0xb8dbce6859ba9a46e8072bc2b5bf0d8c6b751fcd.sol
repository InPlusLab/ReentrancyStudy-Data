COMIC NFTs MEME DAO — 1st PHASE

Fellow Dogees, this is our first medium post to bring you more details about the project.
Our launch is going to be on July—2021 and we are now working hard on the project development. Many more information and medium articles will be released soon.
This article will focus on 1st phase of our DAO Comic.
Lately, we have published two artworks that represent a kind of storyboard with firsts scenes and characters that we are pleased to present you. These two artworks will be a part of our NFTs collection.
We already have the scripts, environments descriptions, characters, and kind of dialog.
THE COMIC DAO PART :
The community will have a voice in what happens next in the story!
For the comic part of our DAO community :
•  Participate in the scenario in the next episodes. The five first are already written.
•  Choose the design of important characters.
•  Choose the artistic direction.
•  Redraw the Story with more dynamism and details
The goal of the comic part is to develop a new comic starting from nothing with our script and ideas and make a funny comic inspired by the crypto world.
Here is our Script for the two first episodes :
1.THE BITE COIN QUEST
ChiHuaHua has got lost in a Transylvanian forest and is drawn to the smell of cats. This smell leads to a somewhat dilapidated old (witch’s) house.
ChiHuaHua knocks on the door, no answer … he allows himself to enter and discovers the interior of the house which is decorated in a particular way (a mix between a witch and a princess world).
In the next room, a noise echoes and a door opens. ChiHuaHua comes face to face with the witch living there, Princess Cized, a mix between CZ, a Chinese tranny, and a witch (a witch who thinks she’s a princess). This dejected witch tells ChiHuaHua that she’s happy (she doesn’t like to be happy) because her cats have been very quiet for a few days.
Her cats used to be chased and abused by the Bones GANG and that didn’t bother the witch at all, as she is a bit sadomasochist.
2.THE GANG BONG
ChiHuaHua leaves the princess’s house. He goes on the indicated path and his flair makes him feel a strong smell that he cannot define.
Following these scents, ChiHuaHua goes deeper and deeper into the mist, unable to see, he uses his flair to move forward. The more he goes, the weirder he feels. The smell leads to an automated Giant Bong. There is an automaton that takes care of recharging the socket and a pump that explodes the smoke and which is therefore responsible for this thick mist.
In the distance, there is some music.
ChiHuaHua, more and more stoned, begins to move towards the source of this music.
Once at the kennel (Compt’Hood Wood), he meets Snoop Dogeee Doge there.
The latter is a kind of druid, herbalist and gang leader. ChiHuaHua meets the Snoop and he does gang signs and steps C Walk.
ChiHuaHua asks him why he’s a gang leader when he’s all alone. Snoop explains that these colleagues have been missing for a few days and that they suspect the cats of having set a trap for them. ChiHuaHua explains that no and that if it was the case the “princess” CZ would have told him.
Snoop continues to think it’s CZ and ChiHuaHua passes out.
ChiHuaHua wakes up outside the mist with a note telling him that she’s a bitch and that he can’t handle the high.
ChiHuaHua still a little bit stunned resumes his way to try to get out of the woods because the night is falling.
Next Episode into one of the next medium post
More Lore and Environments descriptions:
•  Magical world inspired by the “mystery” side of the Scooby-Doo series
•  Funny and inspiring
•  Transylvanian Land
•  Pop Culture
•  Many funny ideas will be released soon ;)
We have also launched a ChiHuaHua NFT Art Contest and a Short story tournament to let the community express themselves. These are supposed to end this week, but we will extend for two weeks the final submission date.
We already have 5 episodes written and most of them have artworks in production. After that, we will submit to our holders a vote about the first act. In any case and with the DAO part, this act can be submitted to a comic artist to finalize and redraw all scenes with more dynamism, dialog, and better caricatures.
THE NEXT, ChiHuaHua ecosystem?
•  Launch of the marketing campaign
•  A lot more information about NFT
•  Deployment of the NFT Minting contract
•  The UI/UX of the new Marketplace
… and many more top secrets folders
Each Point will have a medium article!
