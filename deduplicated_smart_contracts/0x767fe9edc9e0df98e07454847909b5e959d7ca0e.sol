/**
 * @title Illuvium (ILV) ERC20 token
 *
 * @notice Illuvium is a core ERC20 token powering the game.
 *      It serves as an in-game currency, is tradable on exchanges,
 *      it powers up the governance protocol (Illuvium DAO) and participates in Yield Farming.
 *
 * @dev Token Summary:
 *      - Symbol: ILV
 *      - Name: Illuvium
 *      - Decimals: 18
 *      - Initial token supply: 7,000,000 ILV
 *      - Maximum final token supply: 10,000,000 ILV
 *          - Up to 3,000,000 ILV may get minted in 3 years period via yield farming
 *      - Mintable: total supply may increase
 *      - Burnable: total supply may decrease
 *
 * @dev Token balances and total supply are effectively 192 bits long, meaning that maximum
 *      possible total supply smart contract is able to track is 2^192 (close to 10^40 tokens)
 *
 * @dev Smart contract doesn't use safe math. All arithmetic operations are overflow/underflow safe.
 *      Additionally, Solidity 0.8.1 enforces overflow/underflow safety.
 *
 * @dev ERC20: reviewed according to https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20
 *
 * @dev ERC20: contract has passed OpenZeppelin ERC20 tests,
 *      see https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/test/token/ERC20/ERC20.behavior.js
 *      see https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/test/token/ERC20/ERC20.test.js
 *      see adopted copies of these tests in the `test` folder
 *
 * @dev ERC223/ERC777: not supported;
 *      send tokens via `safeTransferFrom` and implement `ERC20Receiver.onERC20Received` on the receiver instead
 *
 * @dev Multiple Withdrawal Attack on ERC20 Tokens (ISBN:978-1-7281-3027-9) - resolved

   *        (what operator sets is what they get)

   *        `target` bitset is returned regardless of the `desired` value
   *        (operator has no authority and cannot modify anything)
   *
   * @dev Example:
   *      Consider an operator with the permissions bitmask     00001111
   *      is about to modify the target permission set          01010101
   *      Operator wants to set that permission set to          00110011
   *      Based on their role, an operator has the permissions
   *      to update only lowest 4 bits on the target, meaning that
   *      high 4 bits of the target set in this example is left
   *      unchanged and low 4 bits get changed as desired:      01010011
   *
   * @param operator address of the contract operator which is about to set the permissions
