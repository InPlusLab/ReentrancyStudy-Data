/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

     *  - the sender must be a registered relay
     *  - the transaction's gas price must be larger or equal to the one that was requested by the sender
     *  - the transaction must have enough gas to not run out of gas if all internal transactions (calls to the
     * recipient) use all gas available to them
     *  - the recipient must have enough balance to pay the relay for the worst-case scenario (i.e. when all gas is

     *
     * If all conditions are met, the call will be relayed and the recipient charged. {preRelayedCall}, the encoded
     * function and {postRelayedCall} will be called in that order.

     * Parameters:
     *  - `from`: the client originating the request
     *  - `to`: the target {IRelayRecipient} contract
     *  - `encodedFunction`: the function call to relay, including data
     *  - `transactionFee`: fee (%) the relay takes over actual gas cost
     *  - `gasPrice`: gas price the client is willing to pay
