// Welcome to the source code of the unofficial Etheremon Swap smart contract! This allows MonSeekers to trustlessly trade mons with each other.
// You can offer up any specific Etheremon you own in exchange for any other specific mon or any mon of a specific class.
// For example, you can offer up your Berrball in exchange for any Dracobra.
// Or you can offer it in exchange for some specific mon specified by object ID, like that level 50 Pangrass named "Donny".
// You can even keep both offers up at once if you want.
// If someone has an offer up that your mon qualifies for (for example if "Donny" belongs to you or you happen to own a Dracobra), you can match that offer to execute the trade, instantly transferring the mons to their new owners.
