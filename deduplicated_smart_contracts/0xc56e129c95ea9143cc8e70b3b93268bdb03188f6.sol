 * @notice Represents a tokenized Put option series for ETH. Internally it Wraps

 *
 * @dev Put options represents the right, not the obligation to sell the underlying asset
 * for strike price units of the strike asset.
 *
 * There are four main actions that can be done with an option:
 *
 * Sellers can mint fungible Put option tokens by locking strikePrice * amountOfOptions
 * strike asset units until expiration. Buyers can exercise their Put, meaning
 * selling their underlying asset for strikePrice * amountOfOptions units of strike asset.
 * At the end, seller can retrieve back its collateral, that could be the underlying asset
 * AND/OR strike based on the contract's current ratio of underlying and strike assets.
 *
 * There are many option's style, but the most usual are: American and European.
 * The difference between them are the moments that the buyer is allowed to exercise and
 * the moment that seller can retrieve its locked collateral.
 *
 *  Exercise:
 *  American -> any moment until expiration
 *  European -> only after expiration and until the end of the exercise window
 *
 *  Withdraw:
 *  American -> after expiration
 *  European -> after end of exercise window
 *
 * Let's take an example: there is such a put option series where buyers
 * may sell 1 ETH for 300 USDC until Dec 31, 2021.
 *
 * In this case:
 *
 * - Expiration date: Dec 31, 2021
 * - Underlying asset: ETH
 * - Strike asset: USDC
 * - Strike price: 300 USDC
 *
 * USDC holders may call mint() until the expiration date, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will lock their USDC into this contract
 * - Will issue put tokens corresponding to this USDC amount
 * - This contract is agnostic about where options could be bought or sold and how much the
 * the option premium should be.
 *
 * USDC holders who also hold the option tokens may call unmint() until the
 * expiration date, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will unlock their USDC from this contract
 * - Will burn the corresponding amount of put tokens
 *
 * Put token holders may call exerciseEth() until the expiration date, to
 * exercise their option, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will sell 1 ETH for 300 USDC (the strike price) each.
 * - Will burn the corresponding amount of put tokens.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Note that after expiration, option tokens are worthless since they can not
 * be exercised and its price should be worth 0 in a healthy market.

 * @notice This contract represents the basic structure of the financial instrument

 *
 * @dev There are four main actions that can be called in an Option:
 *
 * A) mint => A minter can lock collateral and create new options before expiration.
 * B) unmint => The minter who previously minted can choose for leaving its position any given time
 * until expiration.
 * C) exercise => The option bearer the can exchange its option for the collateral at the strike price.
 * D) withdraw => The minter can retrieve collateral at the end of the series.
 *
 * Depending on the type (PUT / CALL) or the exercise (AMERICAN / EUROPEAN), those functions have
 * different behave and should be override accordingly.
