/**
 * @title Timelock Contracts on Ethereum ERC721 tokens.
 *
 * This contract provides a way to create and keep Timelock Contracts for ERC721 tokens.
 * In addition, it contains a collectFees function for securely collecting Liquidity Pool fees
 * from Uniswap V3 NonfungiblePositionManger while still under timelock.
 *
 *
 * Protocol:
 *
 *  1) newContract(timelock, tokenContract, tokenId) - a
 *      sender calls this to create a new TLC on a given token (tokenContract)
 *       for a given token ID. A 32 byte contract id is withdrawn
 *  3) withdraw() - after timelock has expired the sender / creator of the TLC can get their tokens
 *      back with this function.
