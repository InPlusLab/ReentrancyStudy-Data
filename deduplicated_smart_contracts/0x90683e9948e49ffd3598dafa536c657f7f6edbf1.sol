    //

    //      - CobeFriendAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations

    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.

    //

    //      - CobeFriendOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token

    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).

    //

    //      - CobeFriendBreeding: This file contains the methods necessary to breed CobeFriends together, including

    //             keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.

    //

    //      - CobeFriendAuctions: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on CobeFriends or siring

    //             services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one

    //             for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated

    //             through this facet of the core contract.

    //

    //      - CobeFriendMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 CobeFriends.

    //             We can make up to 5000 "promo" CobeFriends that can be given away (especially important when

    //             the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up

    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they

    //             are created, there is a hard limit of 2400*12*12 gen0 CobeFriends. After that, it's all up to the

    //             community to breed, breed, breed!
