/**

 *  Liven crowdsale contract.

 *

 *  There is no ETH hard cap in this contract due to the fact that Liven are

 *  collecting funds in more than one currency. This contract is a single

 *  component of a wider sale. The hard cap for the entire sale is USD $28m.

 *

 *  This sale has a six week time limit which can be extended by the owner. It

 *  can be stopped at any time by the owner.

 *

 *  More information is available on https://livenpay.io.

 *

 *  Minimum contribution: 0.1 ETH

 *  Maximum contribution: 1000 ETH

 *  Minimum duration: 6 weeks from deployment
