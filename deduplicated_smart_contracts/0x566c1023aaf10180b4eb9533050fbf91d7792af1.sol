//***********************************Ether Dice Game
//
//
//  Hello player, this is a Ethereum based dice game. You must deposit minimum of "MinDeposit" to play (+transaction cost), if you send less it wont be counted. 
//  You have a 25% chance of winning the entire balance, whatever that amount is.  On average that means that 3 players will deposit before you will win the balance.
//  Also every 40th player will win the jackpot, so make sure you are that person. The jackpot will be considerably more than the balance, so you have the chance to win big if you deposit fast! The fee and deposit rate can be changed by the owner, and it&#39;s publicly visible, after the dice has a big volume, the fee will be lowered!
//  
//  Good Luck and Have Fun!
