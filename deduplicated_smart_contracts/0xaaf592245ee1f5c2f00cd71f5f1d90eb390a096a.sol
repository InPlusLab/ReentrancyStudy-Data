/**

 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow

 * checks.

 *

 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result

 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an

 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.

 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an

 * operation overflows.

 *

 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire

 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
