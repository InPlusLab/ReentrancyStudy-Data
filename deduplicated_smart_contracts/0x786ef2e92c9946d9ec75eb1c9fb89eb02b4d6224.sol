Seller usage:

Follow the TokenSaleFactory contract using the TokenSaleFactory interface.
Use the createSale function to launch a sale given the subcurrency address 
and the price measured in wei for the smallest of that subcurrency 
for example 0.75 ETH per DGD would be 0.75 * 10^18 / 10^9

Find your tokensale by entering your address into the tokenSalesByOwner owner field
then entering the number you get into the tokensalesall field which is a list of all sales created

Deposit subcurrency to allow people to buy it at the pice you specified.

To withdraw funds use the function transfer_eth and give the amount in wei
To withdraw left over subcurrency use transfer_token given the address of the subcurrency you have deposited
or transfer_asset. Amounts are in the smallest unit of that subcurrency for example 1 DGD would be 10^9


Buyer usage:

Send ETH to a TokenSale address to automatically receive the token being sold.

To verify a TokenSale contract obtain the index and address. Folow the TokenSaleFactory and enter the index into the TokenSalesAll field to verify the address is the same.
Follow the TokenSale addresswith the TokenSale interface to verify the asset being sold is the right subcurrency and that the price is right.
