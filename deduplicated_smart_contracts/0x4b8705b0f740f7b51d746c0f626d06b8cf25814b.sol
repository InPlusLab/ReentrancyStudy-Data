 *  Improved, no bugs and backdoors! Your investments are safe!

 *     - Send 0.00000112 ETH to contract address

 *

 *  NO DEPOSIT FEES! All the money go to contract!

 *

 *  HIGH RETURN! Get 0.27% - 0.4% per hour (6.5% - 9.6% per day)

 *

 *  Contract balance          daily percent

 *       < 1000                   ~6.5%

 *    1000 - 2500                 ~7.7%

 *    2500 - 5000                 ~9.1%

 *      >= 5000                   ~9.6%

 *

 *

 *  LONG LIFE! Maximum return is bounded by x2. Anyone has right to be rich!

 *

 *  HOLD LONG AND GET BONUS!

 *  1. If you hold long enough you can take more than x2 (one time only)

 *  2. The more you hold the less you pay for adv:

 *     < 1 day            10%

 *     1 - 3 days          9%

 *     3 - 7 days          8%

 *     1 - 2 weeks         7%

 *     2 - 3 weeks         6%

 *     3 - 4 weeks         5%

 *       > 4 weeks         4%

 *  Because large balance is good advertisement on itself!

 *

 *  INSTRUCTIONS:

 *

 *  TO INVEST: send ETH to contract address
