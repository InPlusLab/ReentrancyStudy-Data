 * @author Validity Labs AG <[emailÂ protected]>

 *

 * The TTA tokens are issued as participation certificates and represent

 * uncertificated securities within the meaning of article 973c Swiss CO. The

 * issuance of the TTA tokens has been governed by a prospectus issued by

 * Tend Technologies AG.

 *

 * TTA tokens are only recognized and transferable in undivided units.

 *

 * The holder of a TTA token must prove his possessorship to be recognized by

 * the issuer as being entitled to the rights arising out of the respective

 * participation certificate; he/she waives any rights if he/she is not in a

 * position to prove him/her being the holder of the respective token.

 *

 * Similarly, only the person who proves him/her being the holder of the TTA

 * Token is entitled to transfer title and ownership on the token to another

 * person. Both the transferor and the transferee agree and accept hereby

 * explicitly that the tokens are transferred digitally, i.e. in a form-free

 * manner. However, if any regulators, courts or similar would require written

 * confirmation of a transfer of the transferable uncertificated securities

 * from one investor to another investor, such investors will provide written

 * evidence of such transfer.
