/**
 * @title GuessNumber
 * @dev My first smart contract! GuessNumber contract starts with a random,
 * hashed number that the player can try to guess. If the guess is correct,
 * they receive the balance of the contract as a reward (including their bet).
 * If they guess incorrectly, the contract keeps the player&#39;s bet amount. Have fun!
