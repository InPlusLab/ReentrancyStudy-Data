 *
 * Version Test-D
 *
 * Overview:
 * This contract impliments a blind auction for burnable tokens. Each secret bid consists
 * of a hashed bid-tuple, (`price`, `quantity`, `salt`), where price is the maximum amount
 * of ether (in wei) a user is willing to pay per token, quantity is the number of tokens
 * the user wants to buy, and salt is an arbitrary value. Together with the hashed bid-tuple,
 * the user includes an encrypted bid tuple, using the public key of the party running the
 * auction, and of course a deposit sufficient to pay for the bid.
 *
 * At the end of the bidding period, the party running the auction sets a &#39;strike price&#39;,
 * thereby signaling the start of the sale period. During this period all bidders must
 * execute their bids. To execute a bid a user reveals their bid-tuple. All bids with a
 * price at least as high as the strike price are filled, and all bids under the strike
 * price are returned. Bids that are exactly equal to the strike price are partially filled,
 * so that the maximum number of tokens generated does not exceed the total supply.
 *
 * Strike Price:
 * The strike price is calculated offchain by the party running the auction. When each
 * secret bid is submitted an event is generated, which includes the sender address, hashed
 * bid-tuple, encrypted bid-tuple and deposit amount. the party running the auction decrypts
 * the encrypted bid-tuple, and regenerates the hash. If the regenerated hash does not match
 * the hash that was submitted with the secret bid, or if the desposited funds are not
 * sufficient to cover the bid, then the bid is disqualified. (presumably disqualifying
 * invalid bids will be cheaper than validating all the valid bids).
 *
 * The auction is structured with a fixed maximum number of tokens. So to raise the maximum
 * funds the bids are sorted, highest to lowest. Starting the strike-price at the highest
 * bid, it is reduced, bid by bid, to include more bids. The quantity of tokens sold increases
 * each time a new bid is included; but the the token price is reduced. At each step the
 * total raise (token-price times quantity-of-tokens-sold) is computed. And the process ends
 * whenever the total raise decreases, or when the total number of tokens exceeds the total
 * supply.
 *
 * Notes:
 * The `salt` is included in the bid-tuple to discourage brute-force attacks on the inputs
 * to the secret bid.
 *
 * A user cannot submit multiple bids from the same Ether account.
 *
 * Users are required to execute their bids. If a user fails to execute their bid before the
 * end of the sale period, then they forfeit half of their deposit, and receive no tokens.
 * This rule was adopted to prevent users from placing several bids, and only revealing one
 * of them. With this rule, all bids must be executed.
