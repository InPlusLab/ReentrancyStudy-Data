MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

An Owned contract, to be inherited by other contracts.
Requires its owner to be explicitly set in the constructor.
Provides an onlyOwner access modifier.

To change owner, the current owner must nominate the next owner,
who then has to accept the nomination. The nomination can be
cancelled before it is accepted by the new owner by having the
previous owner change the nomination (setting it to 0).

MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This contract is used side by side with external state token
contracts, such as Synthetix and Synth.
It provides an easy way to upgrade contract logic while
maintaining all user balances and allowances. This is designed
to make the changeover as easy as possible, since mappings
are not so cheap or straightforward to migrate.

The first deployed contract would create this state contract,
using it as its store of balances.
When a new contract is deployed, it links to the existing
state contract, whose owner would then change its associated
contract to the new one.

MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The approval state contract is designed to allow a wallet to
authorise another address to perform actions, on a contract,
on their behalf. This could be an automated service
that would help a wallet claim fees / rewards on their behalf.

The concept is similar to the ERC20 interface where a wallet can
approve an authorised party to spend on the authorising party's
behalf in the allowance interface.

Withdrawing approval sets the delegate as false instead of
removing from the approvals list for auditability.

This contract inherits state for upgradeability / associated
contract.
