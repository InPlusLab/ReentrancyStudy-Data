 * Hey, 

 * 

 * You know the rules of ponzi already,

 * but let me briefly explain how this one works ;)

 * 

 * This is your personal 45 days magic piggy bank!

 * 

 * 1. Send fixed amount of ether every 24 hours (5900 blocks).

 * 2. With every new transaction collect exponentially greater return!

 * 3. Keep sending the same amount of ether! (can't trick the code, bro)

 * 4. Don't send too often (early transactions will be rejected, uh oh)

 * 5. Don't be late, you won't loose your %, but who wants to be the last?

 *  

 * Play by the rules and save up to 170%!

 *

 * Gas limit: 150 000 (only the first time, average ~ 50 000)

 * Gas price: https://ethgasstation.info/
