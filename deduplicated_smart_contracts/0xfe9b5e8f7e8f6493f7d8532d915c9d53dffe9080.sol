    // This is the main CryptoKitties contract. In order to keep our code seperated into logical sections,

    // we've broken it up in two ways. First, we have several seperately-instantiated sibling contracts

    // that handle auctions and our super-top-secret genetic combination algorithm. The auctions are

    // seperate since their logic is somewhat complex and there's always a risk of subtle bugs. By keeping

    // them in their own contracts, we can upgrade them without disrupting the main contract that tracks

    // art ownership. The genetic combination algorithm is kept seperate so we can open-source all of

    // the rest of our code without making it _too_ easy for folks to figure out how the genetics work.

    // Don't worry, I'm sure someone will reverse engineer it soon enough!

    //

    // Secondly, we break the core contract into multiple files using inheritence, one for each major

    // facet of functionality of CK. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still

    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:

    //

    //      - ArtBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core

    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus

    //             internal functions for managing these items.

    //

    //      - ArtAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations

    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.

    //

    //      - ArtOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token

    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).

    //

    //      - ArtBreeding: This file contains the methods necessary to breed cats together, including

    //             keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.

    //

    //      - ArtAuctions: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on cats or siring

    //             services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one

    //             for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated

    //             through this facet of the core contract.

    //

    //      - ArtMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 cats.

    //             We can make up to 5000 "promo" cats that can be given away (especially important when

    //             the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up

    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they

    //             are created, there is a hard limit of 50k gen0 cats. After that, it's all up to the

    //             community to breed, breed, breed!
