 * @title Illuvium Pool Base
 *
 * @notice An abstract contract containing common logic for any pool,
 *      be it a flash pool (temporary pool like SNX) or a core pool (permanent pool like ILV/ETH or ILV pool)
 *
 * @dev Deployment and initialization.
 *      Any pool deployed must be bound to the deployed pool factory (IlluviumPoolFactory)
 *      Additionally, 3 token instance addresses must be defined on deployment:
 *          - ILV token address
 *          - sILV token address, used to mint sILV rewards
 *          - pool token address, it can be ILV token address, ILV/ETH pair address, and others
 *
 * @dev Pool weight defines the fraction of the yield current pool receives among the other pools,
 *      pool factory is responsible for the weight synchronization between the pools.
 * @dev The weight is logically 10% for ILV pool and 90% for ILV/ETH pool.
 *      Since Solidity doesn't support fractions the weight is defined by the division of
 *      pool weight by total pools weight (sum of all registered pools within the factory)
 * @dev For ILV Pool we use 100 as weight and for ILV/ETH pool - 900.

 *

 *      - Name: Illuvium
 *      - Decimals: 18
 *      - Initial token supply: 7,000,000 ILV
 *      - Maximum final token supply: 10,000,000 ILV
 *          - Up to 3,000,000 ILV may get minted in 3 years period via yield farming
 *      - Mintable: total supply may increase

 *
 * @dev Token balances and total supply are effectively 192 bits long, meaning that maximum

 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
