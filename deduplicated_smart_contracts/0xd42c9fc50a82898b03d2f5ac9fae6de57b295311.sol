/**
 * @title Migratable
 * Helper contract to support intialization and migration schemes between
 * different implementations of a contract in the context of upgradeability.
 * To use it, replace the constructor with a function that has the
 * `isInitializer` modifier starting with `"0"` as `migrationId`.
 * When you want to apply some migration code during an upgrade, increase
 * the `migrationId`. Or, if the migration code must be applied only after
 * another migration has been already applied, use the `isMigration` modifier.
 * This helper supports multiple inheritance.
 * WARNING: It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that migrations are
 * applied in a correct order, or that they are run at all.
 * See `Initializable` for a simpler version.
