/**
 * Crowdsale has a life span during which investors can make
 * token purchases and the crowdsale will assign them tokens based
 * on a token per ETH rate. Funds collected are forwarded to beneficiary
 * as they arrive.
 *
 * A crowdsale is defined by:
 *	offset (required) - crowdsale start, unix timestamp
 *	length (required) - crowdsale length in seconds
 *  price (required) - token price in wei
 *	soft cap (optional) - minimum amount of funds required for crowdsale success, can be zero (if not used)
 *	hard cap (optional) - maximum amount of funds crowdsale can accept, can be zero (unlimited)
 *  quantum (optional) - enables value accumulation effect to reduce value transfer costs, usually is not used (set to zero)
 *    if non-zero value passed specifies minimum amount of wei to transfer to beneficiary
 *
 * This crowdsale doesn't own tokens and doesn't perform any token emission.
 * It expects enough tokens to be available on its address:
 * these tokens are used for issuing them to investors.
 * Token redemption is done in opposite way: tokens accumulate back on contract's address
 * Beneficiary is specified by its address.
 * This implementation can be used to make several crowdsales with the same token being sold.
