*   ---About the Project--

*    Blockchain-enabled smart contracts have opened a new era of trustless relationships without 

*    intermediaries. This technology opens incredible financial possibilities. Our automated investment 

*    distribution model is written into a smart contract, uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain and can be 

*    freely accessed online. In order to insure our investors' complete security, full control over the 

*    project has been transferred from the organizers to the smart contract: nobody can influence the 

*    system's permanent autonomous functioning.

* 

* ---How to use:--

*  1. Send from ETH wallet to the smart contract address 0x123456789......

*      any amount from 0.02 ETH.

*  2. Verify your transaction in the history of your application or etherscan.io, specifying the address 

*      of your wallet.

*  3. Claim your profit by sending 0.001 ether transaction.

*      We recommend output immediately after 6 hours.

*      Do not wait 25 hours!  

*   RECOMMENDED GAS LIMIT: 200000

*   RECOMMENDED GAS PRICE: https://ethgasstation.info/

*     You can check the payments on the etherscan.io site, in the "Internal Txns" tab of your wallet.

*

* ---It is not allowed to transfer from exchanges, only from your personal ETH wallet, for which you 

*     have private keys.

* 

*    Contracts reviewed and approved by pros!
