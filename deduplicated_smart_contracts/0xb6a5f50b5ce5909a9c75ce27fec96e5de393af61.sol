 *
 *      Welcome to the temporary 𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐛𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭. 
 *      It's currently a place-holder whose only functionality is 
 *      forward-compatability with the soon-to-be-deployed actual 
 *      contract. 
 *
 *      Its job is to accrue funds generated by 𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 to pay out 
 *      as 𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬 to the 𝐋𝐎𝐓 token holders. But that's only the 
 *      start. 𝐋𝐎𝐓 token holders will form a 𝐃𝐀𝐎 who own and run 
 *      𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞, and will be able to vote of the future of the 
 *      platform via this very contract! They'll also get to say where 
 *      𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐟 - Etheraffle's charitable arm - funds go to as well. 
 *      All whilst earning a 𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐝 from ticket sales of 𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞!
