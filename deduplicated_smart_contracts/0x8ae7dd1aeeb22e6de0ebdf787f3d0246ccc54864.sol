/// @title MXL PRE SALE CONTRACT
/// @author Carlos Afonso
/// @dev Changes to this contract will invalidate any security audits done before.
/// It is MANDATORY to protocol audits in the "Security reviews done" section
///  # Security checklists to use in each review:
///  - Consensys checklist https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices
///  - Roland Kofler&#39;s checklist https://github.com/rolandkofler/ether-security
///  - Read all of the code and use creative and lateral thinking to discover bugs
///  # Security reviews done:
///  Date         Auditors       Short summary of the review executed
///  Mar 03 2017 - Roland Kofler  - NO SECURITY REVIEW DONE
///  Mar 07 2017 - Roland Kofler, - Informal Security Review; added overflow protections;
///                Alex Kampa       fixed wrong inequality operators; added maximum amount
///                                 per transactions
///  Mar 07 2017 - Alex Kampa     - Some code clean up; removed restriction of

///  Mar 08 2017 - Bok Khoo       - Complete security review and modifications
///  Mar 09 2017 - Roland Kofler  - Check the diffs between MAR 8 and MAR 7 versions
///  Mar 12 2017 - Bok Khoo       - Renamed TOTAL_PREALLOCATION_IN_WEI
