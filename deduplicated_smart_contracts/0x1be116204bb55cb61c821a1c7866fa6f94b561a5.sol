/**
 * title:  The DFINITY Stiftung donation contract (FDC).
 * author: Timo Hanke 
 *
 * This contract 
 *  - accepts on-chain donations for the foundation in ether 
 *  - tracks on-chain and off-chain donations made to the foundation
 *  - assigns unrestricted tokens to addresses provided by donors
 *  - assigns restricted tokens to DFINITY Stiftung and early contributors 
 *
 * On-chain donations are received in ether are converted to Swiss francs (CHF).
 * Off-chain donations are received and recorded directly in Swiss francs.
 * Tokens are assigned at a rate of 10 tokens per CHF. 
 *
 * There are two types of tokens initially. Unrestricted tokens are assigned to
 * donors and restricted tokens are assigned to DFINITY Stiftung and early 
 * contributors. Restricted tokens are converted to unrestricted tokens in the 
 * finalization phase, after which only unrestricted tokens exist.
 *
 * After the finalization phase, tokens assigned to DFINITY Stiftung and early 
 * contributors will make up a pre-defined share of all tokens. This is achieved
 * through burning excess restricted tokens before their restriction is removed.

 * Optionally, assignments can be chosen to be of "restricted type". 
 * Being "restricted" means that the token assignment may later be partially
 * reverted (or the tokens "burned") by the contract. 
 *
 * After all token assignments are completed the contract
 *   - burns some restricted tokens
 *   - releases the restriction on the remaining tokens
 * The percentage of tokens that burned out of each assignment of restricted
 * tokens is calculated to achieve the following condition:
 *   - the remaining formerly restricted tokens combined have a pre-configured
 *     share (percentage) among all remaining tokens.
 *
 * Once the conversion process has started the contract enters a state in which
 * no more assignments can be made.
