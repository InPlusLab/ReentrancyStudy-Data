 *
 *      Welcome to the temporary 𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐟 contract. It's just
 *      a place-holder for now, with little functionality other 
 *      than being forward compatible with the first version of 
 *      the 𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐟 contract in current development. 
 *
 *      This contract acts as a temporary store for the ether 
 *      raised each week from the ticket sales of 𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞, 
 *      for the future funding of the charitable arm of the 
 *      enterprise. It is the nascent beginnings of a blockchain 
 *      portal for donations to good causes worldwide, driven by a 
 *      decentralized cadre of 𝐋𝐎𝐓 token holders, forming part
 *      of a 𝐃𝐀𝐎 who both own and run 𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 & 𝐄𝐭𝐡𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐟.
