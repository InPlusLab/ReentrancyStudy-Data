/*

 * This is an example gambling contract that works without any ABI interface.

 * The entire game logic is invoked by calling the fallback function which

 * is triggered, e.g. upon receiving a transaction at the contract address

 * without any data sent along. The contract is attackable in a number of ways:

 * - as soon as someone paid in Ether and starts the game, register with a

 *   large number of addresses to spam the player list and most likely win.

 * - blockhash as source of entropy is attackable by miners

 * - probably further exploits

 * This only serves as a minimalistic example of how to gamble on Ethereum
