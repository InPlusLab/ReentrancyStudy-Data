/**
 * @title DualityConsole
 * Duality is a simple smart contract that allows two parties to open up a Duality contract
 * together where each party has their own currency, but this currency can only be
 * redeemed back to the party that minted them. This allows one party to mint
 * tokens as a gift to the other party, and the other party may then come back in the
 * future to redeem this currency for goods or services.
