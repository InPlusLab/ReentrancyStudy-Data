*
* This is an ERC-721 NFT smart contract for the first GCAC NFT containing 741 unique tokens
* that may be used in any/all future metaverses based on the Ethereum blockchain. 
*
* This GCAC NFT has the following traits which have a varying set of color rarities:
*  "Bottle"
*  "Phone"
*  "Screen"
*  "Background"
*  "Block"
*  "Label"
*
* Who knows, a holder of a GCAC NFT with a Brown "Bottle" may be able to get the best
* medical cannabis to use as a healing method .. only time and the metaverse will tell!
*
* 1. The number of GCAC NFTs from this contract shall be seven hundred and forty one (741).
* 2. One (1) NFT with a "Myhtic" rarity was awarded to our competition winner.
* 3. Twenty (20) NFTs with a "Legendary" rarity were awarded to our top 20 GCAC ERC-20 
*    hodlers on 31-August-2021 0900 ET.
* 4. Three hundred and seventeen (317) NFTs with a "Common" rarity were awarded to 
*    all other GCAC ERC-20 token hodlers on 31-August-2021 0900 ET.
* 5. The remaining four hundred and two (402) GCAC NFTs are avaiable to purchase 
*    by the general public by calling mintToken() and paying the mintCost price in ETH.

* ========== 
* 1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is designed to be globally inclusive. 
* 2. Centralized finance is based around private share sales to wealthy individuals or
*    the trading of shares on national stock markets, both have high barriers to entry. 
* 3. The Abbey DeFi methodology offers public and private companies exposure to DeFi.
*
* Abbey is a Uniswap-based DeFi service provider that allows companies to offer people a 
* novel way to speculate on the success of their business in a decentralized manner.
* 
* The premise is both elegant and simple, the company commits to a token buyback based on 
* its sales revenue and commits to stabilize a tokens price by adding to the liquidity pool.
* 
* Using Abbey as a Uniswap DeFi management agency, the company spends sales revenue, as ETH, 
* buying one side of a bespoke Uniswap trading pair. The other side of the Uniswap pair 
* is the TNDY token.
* 
* DeFi traders wishing to speculate on the revenue growth of the company deposit ETH in return 
* for GCAC Uniswap tokens. The Uniswap Automated Market Maker ensures DeFi market 
* liquidity and legitimate price discovery. The more ETH that the company deposits over time, 
* the higher the value of the GCAC token, as held by DeFi speculators.

 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
