 * @title Timelocker
 * @author 0age
 * @notice This contract allows contracts that inherit it to implement timelocks
 * on functions, where the `_setTimelock` internal function must first be called
 * and passed the target function selector and arguments. Then, a given time
 * interval must first fully transpire before the timelock functions can be
 * successfully called. Furthermore, once a timelock is complete, it will expire
 * after a period of time. In order to change timelock intervals or expirations,
 * the inheriting contract needs to implement `modifyTimelockInterval` and
 * `modifyTimelockExpiration` functions, respectively, as well as functions that
 * call `_setTimelock` in order to initiate the timelocks for those functions.
 * To make a function timelocked, use the `_enforceTimelock` internal function.
 * To set initial defult minimum timelock intervals and expirations, use the
 * `_setInitialTimelockInterval` and `_setInitialTimelockExpiration` internal
 * functions - they can only be used during contract creation. Finally, there
 * are three public getters: `getTimelock`, `getDefaultTimelockInterval`, and
 * `getDefaultTimelockExpiration`.

 * This contract also allows for immediately triggering a "rollback" to a prior
 * implementation in the event that a new vulnerability is introduced. It can
 * roll back to any implementation for a given controller + upgrade beacon pair
 * unless that implementation has been explicitly "blocked" by the owner.
 *
 * It also specifies dedicated implementations for the Dharma Smart Wallet and
 * Dharma Key Ring upgrade beacons that can be triggered in an emergency or in
 * the event of an extended period of inactivity from Dharma. These contingency
 * implementations give the user the ability to withdraw any funds on their
 * smart wallet by submitting a transaction directly from the account of any of
 * their signing keys, but are otherwise kept as simple as possible. After 48
 * hours in the contingency state, the owner may bypass the standard upgrade
 * timelock and trigger upgrades to the smart wallet and key ring implementation
 * contracts. Note that triggering a rollback, or performing a standard upgrade,
 * will cause the contingency state to be exited if it is active at the time.
 *
 * This contract can transfer ownership of any upgrade beacon controller it owns
 * (subject to the timelock on `transferControllerOwnership`), in order to
 * introduce new upgrade conditions or to otherwise alter the way that upgrades
 * are carried out.
