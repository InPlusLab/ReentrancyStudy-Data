***TOKEN INFORMATION***

NAME: DeveloperToken

SYMBOL: DEV 

TOTAL SUPPLY: 500,000



To Purchase DEV Tokens send Ethereum to this smart contract



Prices are as follows



0.001 ETH =      20 DEV

0.01  ETH =     200 DEV

0.10  ETH =   2,000 DEV

0.25  ETH =   5,000 DEV

0.50  ETH =  10,000 DEV

1.00  ETH =  20,000 DEV

10    ETH = 200,000 DEV



 

 Hey guys, my name is James and I'm an ERC20 developer and crypto activist.

 

 Times are tough for me at the moment and I don't have work right now.

 

 I created this Token because I'm looking for Work or any Donations if you guys can afford to

 help a brother out any donations would be greatly appreciated. 

 

 I can create you your own erc20 Token if you're interested, including crowdsale functions and 

 contract verification on Etherscan.

 

 If you buy 5000 of my DEV Tokens for 0.25 ETH then I will gladly create you your own erc20 Token.

 I know its cheap but I'm pretty desperate at the moment, no work, no money and I don't want to 

 have a shitty Christmas you know.

 

 You can email me on moneymakingmaster123 @ gmail.com 

 (Yeah my email address is ironic considering I'm a broke ass right now)

 

 ---Please include the following information in your email

 

 * Token Name:

 * Ticket/Symbol:

 * Total Supply:

 * Price per Token in ETH:

 * Address of where initial supply should go:

 * Address where the funds raised should go:

 * Any other requirements you may have (Be reasonable, the price is for a basic contract)

 * Your wallet address to prove you hold 5000 DEV Tokens



Thanks so much guys
