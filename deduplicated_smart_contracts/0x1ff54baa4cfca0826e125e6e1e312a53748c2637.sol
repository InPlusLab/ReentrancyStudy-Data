// Welcome to LimeEyes!
//
// This smart contract allows users to purchase shares of any artwork that's
// been added to the system and it will pay dividends to all shareholders
// upon the purchasing of new shares! It's special in the way it works because
// the shares can only be bought in certain amounts and the price of those 
// shares is dependant on how many other shares there are already. Each
// artwork starts with 1 share available for purchase and upon each sale,
// the number of shares for purchase will increase by one (1 -> 2 -> 3...),
// each artwork also has an owner and they will always get the dividends from 
// the number of shares up for purchase, for example;
/*
    If the artwork has had shares purchased 4 times, the next purchase will
    be for 5 shares of the artwork. Upon the purchasing of these shares, the
    owner will receive the dividends equivelent to 5 shares worth of the sale
    value. It's also important to note that the artwork owner cannot purchase
    shares of their own art, instead they just inherit the shares for purchase
    and pass it onto the next buyer at each sale.
*/ 
// The price of the shares also follows a special formula in order to maintain
// stability over time, it uses the base price of an artwork (set by the dev 
// upon the creation of the artwork) and the total number of shares purchased
// of the artwork. From here you simply treat the number of shares as a percentage
// and add that much on top of your base price, for example;
/*
    If the artwork has a base price of 0.01 ETH and there have been 250 shares 
    purchased so far, it would mean that the base price will gain 250% of it's
    value which comes to 0.035 ETH (100% + 250% of the base price).
*/
// The special thing about this is because the shares are intrinsicly linked with
// the price, the dividends from your shares will trend to a constant value instead
// of continually decreasing over time. Because our sequence of shares is a triangular
// number (1 + 2 + 3...) the steady state of any purchased shares will equal the number
// of shares owned (as a percentage) * the artworks base price, for example;
/*
    If the artwork has a base price of 0.01 ETH and you own 5 shares, in the long run
    you should expect to see 5% * 0.01 ETH = 0.0005 ETH each time the artwork has any
    shares purchased. In contrast, if you own 250 shares of the artwork, you should 
    expect to see 250% * 0.01 ETH = 0.025 ETH each time the artwork has shares bought.
  
    It's good to point out that if you were the first buyer and owned 1 share, the next
    buyer is going to be purchasing 2 shares which means you have 1 out of the 3 shares
    total and hence you will receive 33% of that sale, at the next step there will be
    6 shares total and your 1 share is now worth 16% of the sale price, as mentioned
    above though, your earnings upon the purchasing of new shares from your original
    1 share will trend towards 1% of the base price over a long period of time.
