# A constant used in `_can_deposit_or_withdraw` when comparing Lido share prices.
#
# Due to integer rounding, Lido.getPooledEthByShares(10**18) may return slightly
# different numbers even if there were no oracle reports between two calls. This
# might happen if someone submits ETH before the second call. It can be mathematically
# proven that this difference won't be more than 10 wei given that Lido holds at least
# 0.1 ETH and the share price is of the same order of magnitude as the amount of ETH
# held. Both of these conditions are true if Lido operates normally—and if it doesn't,
# it's desirable for AnchorVault operations to be suspended. See:
