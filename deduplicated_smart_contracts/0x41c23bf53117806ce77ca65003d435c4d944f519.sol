 * @title Contractus contract

 * Funds distribution:

 * 90% - deposit funds

 * 3%  - support

 * 7% -  marketing

 * Allows you to receive income up to 2 deposit amounts and above if you continue to keep the deposit. 

 * You can receive income 200% or more only once. In this case the deposit is closed. 

 * Thus, the longer you keep the deposit open and do not withdraw your income, the more your potential gain becomes.

 *Payments are terminated after the completion of 200%. To re-enter the game, you must replenish your deposit.

 * You can receive your income at any time, based on a 2.5% per day calculation to 200%

 * 

 * This contract is a game - a lottery, in which prizes - payments on the deposit. 

 * The contract is not a pyramid, since all deposits have a finite period of validity of payments. 

 * You should not use this contract for investment purposes. Only for the game - lottery.

 * By sending funds to this contract, you should understand that it is possible that the balance 

 * of the contract will not be enough to pay all players. 

 * Contract developers have not left themselves any functions for the withdrawal of players' funds, 

 * but this is just a game - remember this.
