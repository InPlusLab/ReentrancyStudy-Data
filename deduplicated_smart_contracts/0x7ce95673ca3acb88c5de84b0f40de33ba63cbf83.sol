/**
 * @title Meta Pool Token
 * @author APY.Finance
 * @notice This token is used to keep track of the capital that has been
 * pulled from the PoolToken contracts.
 *
 * When the PoolManager pulls capital from the PoolToken contracts to
 * deploy to yield farming strategies, it will mint mAPT and transfer it to
 * the PoolToken contracts. The ratio of the mAPT held by each PoolToken
 * to the total supply of mAPT determines the amount of the TVL dedicated to
 * PoolToken.
 *
 * DEPLOY CAPITAL TO YIELD FARMING STRATEGIES
 * Tracks the share of deployed TVL owned by an PoolToken using mAPT.
