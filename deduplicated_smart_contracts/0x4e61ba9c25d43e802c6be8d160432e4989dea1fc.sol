/*
  Allows buyers to securely/confidently buy recent ICO tokens that are
  still non-transferrable, on an IOU basis. Like HitBTC, but with protection,
  control, and guarantee of either the purchased tokens or ETH refunded.

  The Buyer&#39;s ETH will be locked into the contract until the purchased
  IOU/tokens arrive here and are ready for the buyer to invoke withdraw(),
  OR until cut-off time defined below is exceeded and as a result ETH
  refunds/withdrawals become enabled.

  The buyer&#39;s ETH will ONLY be released to the seller AFTER the buyer
  manually withdraws their tokens by sending this contract a transaction
  with 0 ETH.

  In other words, the seller must fulfill the IOU token purchases any time
  before the cut-off time defined below, otherwise the buyer gains the
  ability to withdraw their ETH.

  Estimated Time of Distribution: 3-5 weeks from ICO according to TenX
  Cut-off Time: ~ August 9, 2017

      Main mechanism to ensure a buyer&#39;s purchase/ETH/IOU is safe.

      Refund the buyer&#39;s ETH if we&#39;re beyond the cut-off date of our distribution
      promise AND if the contract doesn&#39;t have an adequate amount of tokens
      to distribute to the buyer. Time-sensitive buyer/ETH protection is only
      applicable if the contract doesn&#39;t have adequate tokens for the buyer.

      The "adequacy" check prevents the seller and/or third party attacker
      from locking down buyers&#39; ETH by sending in an arbitrary amount of tokens.

      If for whatever reason the tokens remain locked for an unexpected period
      beyond the time defined by block.number, patient buyers may still wait until
      the contract is filled with their purchased IOUs/tokens. Once the tokens
      are here, they can initiate a withdraw() to retrieve their tokens. Attempting
      to withdraw any sooner (after the block has been mined, but tokens not arrived)
      will result in a refund of buyer&#39;s ETH.
