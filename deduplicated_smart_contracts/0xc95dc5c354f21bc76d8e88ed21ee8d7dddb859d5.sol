 * Easy Invest FOREVER NEVERENDING Contract

 *  - GAIN VARIABLE INTEREST EVERY 5900 blocks (approx. 24 hours) UP TO 10% PER DAY (dependent on incoming and outgoing ETH) but minimum of 0.05% for longevity.

 *  - ZERO SUM GAME WITH ADDED LINKED DAPPS BRINGING POSITIVE EXPECTATION

 *  - NO FEES are collected by the owner, in fact, there is no owner at all (just look at the code)

 *  - ADDED GAME ELEMENT OF CHOOSING THE BEST TIME TO WITHDRAW TO MAXIMIZE INTEREST (less frequent withdrawals at higher interest rates will return faster)

 *  - ONLY 90ETH balance increase per day above previous high needed for 10% interest so whales will boost the contract to newer heights to receive higher interest.

 *  - NO USA ALLOWED - - NO COMMISSION on your investment (every ether stays in contract's balance)

 *  - For Fairness on high interest days, a maximum of only 10% of total investment can be returned per withdrawal so you should make withdrawals regularly or lose the extra interest.

 * 

 * How to use:

 *  1. Send any amount of ether to make an investment

 *  2a. Claim your profit by sending 0 ether transaction (every day, every week, i don't care unless you're spending too much on GAS)

 *  OR

 *  2b. Send more ether to reinvest AND get your profit at the same time

 *

 * RECOMMENDED GAS LIMIT: 70000

 * RECOMMENDED GAS PRICE: https://ethgasstation.info/

 *

 * Contract reviewed and approved by pros!
