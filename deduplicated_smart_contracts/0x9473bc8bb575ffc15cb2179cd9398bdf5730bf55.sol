 /*
    Brief introduction:
    
    To play you need to pick 4 numbers (range 0-255) and provide them sorted to Play() function.
    To win you need to hit at least 1 number out of 4 WinningNums which will be announced once every week
    (or more often if the lottery will become more popular). If you hit all of the 4 numbers you will win
    about 10 million times more than you payed for lottery ticket. The exact values are provided as GuessXOutOf4
    entries in Ledger - notice that they are provided in Wei, not Ether (10^18 Wei = Ether).
    Use Withdraw() function to pay out.


    The advantage of TheEthereumLottery is that it uses secret random value which only owner knows (called TheRand).
    A hash of TheRand (called OpeningHash) is announced at the beginning of every draw (lets say draw number N) - 
    at this moment ticket price and the values of GuessXOutOf4 are publicly available and can not be changed.
    When draw N+1 is announced in a block X, a hash of block X-1 is assigned to ClosingHash field of draw N.
    After few minutes, owner announces TheRand which satisfy following expression: sha3(TheRand)==drawN.OpeningHash
    then Rand32B=sha3(TheRand, ClosingHash) is calculated an treated as a source for WinningNumbers, 
    also ClosingHash is changed to Rand32B as it might be more interesting for someone watching lottery ledger
    to see that number instead of hash of some block. 

    This approach (1) unable players to cheat, as as long as no one knows TheRand, 
    no one can predict what WinningNums will be, (2) unable owner to influence the WinningNums (in order to
    reduce average amount won) because OpeningHash=sha3(TheRand) was public before bets were made, and (3) reduces 
    owner capability of playing it&#39;s own lottery and making winning bets to very short window of one
    exactly the same block as new draw was announced - so anyone, with big probability, can think that if winning
    bet was made in this particular block - probably it was the owner, especially if no more bets were made 
    at this block (which is very likely).

    Withdraw is possible only after TheRand was announced, if the owner will not announce TheRand in 2 weeks,
    players can use Refund function in order to refund their ETH used to make bet. 
    That moment is called ExpirationTime on contract Ledger (which is visible from JSON interface).
