 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow

 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.

 * @title Midas Distributor
 * @dev A smart-contract based mechanism to distribute tokens over time, inspired loosely by
 *      Compound, Uniswap and Ampleforth.
 *
 *      The ampleforth geyser has the concept of a 'locked pool' in the geyser. MidasDistributor
 *      performs a similar action to the ampleforth geyser locked pool but allows for multiple
 *      geysers (which we call MidasAgents).
 *
 *      Distribution tokens are added to a pool in the contract and, over time, are sent to
 *      multiple midas agents based on a distribution share. Each agent gets a set
 *      percentage of the pool each time a distribution occurs.
 *
 *      Before unstaking the tokens in an agent it would be benifical to maximise the 
 *      take: to perform a distribution. That distribution event would be at the stakholders
 *      expense, and we allow anyone to perform a distribution.
 *
 *      Multiple midas agents can be registered, deregistered and have their distribution
 *      percentage adjusted. The distributor must be locked for adjustments to be made.
 *
 *      More background and motivation available at the AmpleForthGold github & website.
