/**
 * @title Standing order
 * @dev Lifecycle of a standing order:
 *  - the payment amount per interval is set at construction time and can not be changed afterwards
 *  - the payee is set by the owner and can not be changed after creation
 *  - at <startTime> (unix timestamp) the first payment is due
 *  - every <intervall> seconds the next payment is due
 *  - the owner can add funds to the order contract at any time
 *  - the owner can withdraw only funds that do not (yet) belong to the payee
 *  - the owner can terminate a standingorder anytime. Termination results in:
 *    - No further funding being allowed
 *    - order marked as "terminated" and not being displayed anymore in owner UI
 *    - as long as there are uncollected funds entitled to the payee, it is still displayed in payee UI
 *    - the payee can still collect funds owned to him
 *
 *   * Terminology *
 *   "withdraw" -> performed by owner - transfer funds stored in contract back to owner
 *   "collect"  -> performed by payee - transfer entitled funds from contract to payee
 *
 *   * How does a payment work? *
 *   Since a contract can not trigger a payment by itself, it provides the method "collectFunds" for the payee.
 *   The payee can always query the contract to determine how many funds he is entitled to collect.
 *   The payee can call "collectFunds" to initiate transfer of entitled funds to his address.
