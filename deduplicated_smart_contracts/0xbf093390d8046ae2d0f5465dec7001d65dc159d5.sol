MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

An Owned contract, to be inherited by other contracts.
Requires its owner to be explicitly set in the constructor.
Provides an onlyOwner access modifier.

To change owner, the current owner must nominate the next owner,
who then has to accept the nomination. The nomination can be
cancelled before it is accepted by the new owner by having the
previous owner change the nomination (setting it to 0).

MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This contract is used side by side with external state token
contracts, such as Synthetix and Synth.
It provides an easy way to upgrade contract logic while
maintaining all user balances and allowances. This is designed
to make the changeover as easy as possible, since mappings
are not so cheap or straightforward to migrate.

The first deployed contract would create this state contract,
using it as its store of balances.
When a new contract is deployed, it links to the existing
state contract, whose owner would then change its associated
contract to the new one.
