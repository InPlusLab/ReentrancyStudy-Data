Glorious Community Coin

Glorious Community Coin White Paper
An epidemic sent the global economy into panic. Oil, gold, and bonds did not play as a safe haven for the capital. U.S. stocks fell steeply from historical highs, triggering the fusing mechanism several times, causing global stock markets to continue to plummet. When the COVID-19 virus appeared at an early stage in 2020, Bitcoin seemed to play the role of a "hedging tool". The real economy has plummeted, but bitcoin-led cryptocurrencies have continued to rise, and many blockchain advocates believed that the world of cryptocurrencies will usher in a big explosion. Unexpectedly, the crypto market ushered in a collective plunge in cryptocurrency prices in early March. Cryptocurrency market value lost two-thirds in a week. Bitcoin is no exception. Although Mr. Satoshi Nakamoto's original intention was to use Bitcoin as a medium to break through the unfair restrictions of the world's national fiat-based economic system, US dollar stays strong as usual at this time. Here, I believe that blockchain advocates of decentralized autonomous organizations need to consider whether cryptocurrencies can stand alone when the world economy is in the crisis and may repeat the 1929 economic recession? In the future, is it necessary for cryptocurrencies to seek a direction that combines "defoaming" and "real economy" in order to realize the ideal kingdom of Satoshi Nakamoto?
The following is a cryptocurrency feasibility scheme with its reasoning that I previously deduced based on the theory of capitalism. I wanted to explore it as a trend of thought in academia, but I have to consider implementing it in this shaking period. This solution aims to make capitalists' capital increase rapidly in the crypto world and become an excellent refuge for the capital. Without affecting the income of capitalists, participants can also join in a great event that really changes the destiny of human beings through crypto assets --- make it possible for children living in the poverty all over the world to receive the best education. They see the world, while the world sees them.
Text:
"Money" has always been at the core of world economics. Money is also an indispensable booster for capitalist wealth appreciation. Humans have changed from ancient bartering to the coinage of the kingdom of Lydia in 650 BC. Suddenly, all food, even people themselves, had a clear market price, and different prices resulted in different classes---the rich and the poor. Since that era, the "currency" boom has promoted land mergers and population trading, widened the gap between rich and poor, and strengthened the social foundation of religious philosophy. In the 21st century, from the Internet to globalization, from the real economy to the emergence of the digital economy, the distribution of wealth assets in the world has been further changed. After the global financial crisis in 2008, the well-known cryptocurrency "Bitcoin" further refreshed human perception of "currency". I, like many scholars, believe that cryptocurrencies will become a reliable value medium that connects the world across political entities. This is the future of currency and it is booming due to the rapid advancement of digital technology. Unlike ancient metal currencies, which spent one to two centuries marching the European continent, cryptocurrencies will spread all over the world through trades between non-government entities within few years. It will redefine human perception of "money."

Since the US dollar broke away from the precious metal standard in 1971, currencies issued by countries around the world have become non-equivalent exchanges between the actual value of currencies and the face value of banknotes. The 2018 version of the US $ 100 only costs 14.2 cents for printing materials and labor in total, but this US $ 100 note fully carries out the purchasing power of US $ 100 instead. This means that, during the issuance stage, the US government collected approximately 99.99858% coinage tax. The obligation of the seigniorage collected by the government is to provide public goods, including national defense, diplomacy, infrastructures, social welfare, medical care, education and so on, to the public within the political territory. The loss of 99.99858% of the currency value will be compensated after a certain period of time, so this can be regarded as an exchange of equivalent value.

This kind of economic operation enabled regimes to issue currency for a long time. However, blockchain technology has made it possible for the nongovernmental to issue "currency". Non-sovereign currencies, including Bitcoin, all seem to share the three major properties of "money"-pricing, circulation, and confirmation. They circulate freely and function well in payment and transfer. However, since the "currency" issued by the private sector does not have a seigniorage, it cannot reflect the endogenous value of "currency". So, as Buffett said, financially, Bitcoin can be only used for transactions but not storage.

Therefore, the "pricing" section is definitely a pain point of today's cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have no real values without the support of economic entities . Just like the railway bonds issued in the late Eastern Qing Dynasty, no one could acquire their expected value due to the overthrow of the Qing government. Today, railway bonds still have pricing and circulating transaction value in the hands of collectors, but the "pricing" on bonds has become a bad debt due to the disappearance of the issuing entity.
In addition to "pricing" difficulties, there is also a misunderstanding of "credit" in the blockchain. Many advocates of blockchain believe that blockchain can establish credit between people. However, in practical applications, the blockchain technology does not solve the problem of the lack of trust in human society. Blockchain just guarantees that the data itself cannot be faked, is transparent, and cannot be tampered with. The so-called "credit" still needs humans to fulfil. If the entity issuing the cryptocurrency chooses not to keep its promise or simply disappears, the cryptocurrency will be worthless. The value of cryptocurrencies cannot be guaranteed, let alone the blockchain can strengthen the "credit" between people. So why people trust fiat currencies? The trust to the government has been accumulated in the past hundreds of years. The value of the fiat currency is covered by the comprehensive value return from the regions to which they belong, so the people are willing to accept the fiat currency issued by their governments. Humans also use the fiat currencies of different countries to spread risk or fight, such as Africa people use US dollars to resist the local government's untrustworthy currency.

It is not difficult to understand the attributes of mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Let's take the main trading pair in the mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges --- Bitcoin and USDT (Tether Coin) as an example. The USDT is backed by the US dollar corresponding to the foundation's savings. Therefore, although USDT is called cryptocurrency, it is actually an encrypted expression of the trust system the US dollar represented, which shares no difference with the electronic money marked in China's WeChat and Alipay. They only differ in the technologies they used : Blockchain technology for the former, and Internet technology for the latter. Bitcoin can also be simply classified as a transaction medium mainly with the US dollar, and has transaction value with it, but it does not correspond to the economic value of any entity . This expands the possibility that if one day, a cryptocurrency of similar nature occurs and a constant benchmarking mechanism can be created between the crypto and the real economic entities, Bitcoin would turn into a collection only eventually.

Since the advent of Bitcoin, the issuance of tokens by private institutions has become increasingly popular. Many white papers claim that their projects will definitely exceed Bitcoin in the future, giving investors the illusion of getting rich overnight. As a result, in addition to Ethereum has chased Bitcoin with smart contracts, Bitcoin so far has no rivals. When a large amount of money flowed into Bitcoin, Bitcoin once reached $ 20,000 per coin in 2017. Recent days it slid to $ 3800, with a total market value of less than $ 70 billion. So, is it impossible that Bitcoin cannot be defeated? For experienced capitalists, Bitcoin serves as a reference for them to know how to accumulate their capital by cryptocurrency . Compared to the 2008 U.S. Lehman bond they created, or Deutsche Bank¡¯s more than 40 trillion euros of derivative financial product bubbles in 2020, or the Greek bond crisis, the market value of Bitcoin's $ 70 billion is far less than the market value of "Mars-landing Tesla " or "Nike, a leisure sports brand". Bitcoin is only one of the 10 million listed companies in the eyes of capitalists. Without seeing any real economy underpinning its value, Bitcoin fails to interest them.

"Beyond Bitcoin" is not an out of reach if the capitalists would use traditional financial principles and capital operations to create a capitalism currency that is in line with financial logic,  after they know how Bitcoin transactions are operated and the rules of crypto currency issuance. The situation capitalists facing now is also a great opportunity to give birth to "beyond Bitcoin". At present, the world's banking systems have begun to enter the CRS "Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters" mechanism. Offshore companies and offshore accounts used by capitalists as legal tax avoidance have gradually become the targets of governments in various countries. History shows that governments of British, German and American added tax burden before---once imposed a 90% tax on capitalists. Coupled with the fact that countries are now further revising the inheritance tax rate, capitalist property continues to shrink. At present, the inheritance tax in Europe and the United States is between 30% and 50%, but with an adjustment mechanism. The inheritance tax in the United States and Britain once rose to 80% in the history.  And China also is promoting inheritance tax in 2020. For the capitalists, it is undoubtedly a heavy burden given by regimes worldwide.

French economist Thomas Piketty proposed in the Capital in the Twenty-first Century a fundamental chemotaxis force of capital society: r> g, where r represents the return on capital (which includes recovered profits, dividends, interest, rent, and other capital income, expressed as a percentage of total capital), g represents the rate of economic growth (that is, the increase in annual income or output). If r is much larger than g, it means that the rate of accumulation of original capital is significantly faster than the growth of total social output. The author systematically combed a large amount of historical data and found that the inequality r> g is the normal state of capitalist society. If there is no external force to block it, such as war, social movements or government intervention, the polarization of the rich and the poor will continue to increase, and eventually the poor the poorer, the rich the richer. According to his accounting, the global rate of return will further increase by 6-7 times, that is, the return on capital is six to seven times greater than the economic growth rate. In the future, wealth will be highly concentrated in the world, and hereditary capitalism will make a comeback in the 21st century. Therefore, he suggested that a global capital tax be imposed to solve the problem of uneven wealth distribution. Although the book states that this is only a utopian idea, it also represents high-end academic experts who believe that in the long run, the government can't help but form more tax policy for the rich.

Nowadays, emerging economies are facing huge risks due to the continuous economic crisis in various countries in the world. Sovereign national fiat currencies such as the Turkish Lira and the Argentine Peso have fallen by almost 40% in the past few months; Germany, the largest European economy, where its largest bank of more than 40 trillion derivative products is facing huge default risks; The EU and the UK, a traditional financial power have great potential currency crisis ambush because of Brexit ; the risk of China ¡¯s issuing excessive currency is increasing , etc. . All of them have brought instability to the capitalists. In my opinion, the time has come to issue a cryptocurrency based on capitalism. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto used point-to-point encrypted distributed ledger technology to practice the feasibility of currency issuance by non-political entities, and has created more than 70 billion US dollars of "value trading economy". According to the inequality of r> g ,that is, the power of capital in the 21st century will increase by 6-7 times, if the capitalist issues cryptocurrency with its own capital power and according to objective currency valuations with reference to the real economy, it can be expected that this cryptocurrency will become the world's fastest-growing purchasing power and function as a "capitalist foundation" cryptocurrency equivalent to offshore accounts.  This cryptocurrency can actually achieve the attributes of a good currency that is "pricing, circulation, and right confirmation". Among them, the pricing is supported by the strength of capitalists around the world, and able to eventually be "beyond Bitcoin"!

I am very interested in blockchain technology and economics. I found that the technology of public chain in the field of blockchain finance can be simply analogized to the registration system for issuing stocks on the NASDAQ exchange in the United States. The registration system plays the role of third-party supervision within the NASDAQ exchange, supervising the number of stocks traded, trading information and rights of stock holders to ensure that the information of all parties is authentic and credible. The benefits of Blockchain to traditional finance is still based on the highlights and development potential of the project itself, not on the algorithm or technical content of the blockchain technology.

The followings are the roles of blockchain technology in finance in my thoughts:
1. This technology allows the public to participate in monitoring all transaction processes
2. This technology can ensure that the public knows the exact data of the total circulation and total amount of crypto assets
3. This technology can maximize the protection of the token rights in the personal account
4. This technology can support peer-to-peer transfers and ensure safe circulation

The above four points are my personal summary of the technical functions of the blockchain. Whether it is POW, POS, DPOS technology or any new point-to-point distributed ledger technology, it can meet the transaction elements of the financial industry. Therefore, I believe that blockchain finance undoubtedly provides a global publicly trusted securities regulatory commission for strangers, but this securities regulatory commission only provides comprehensive monitoring of the liquidity and security of tokens through digital technology. However, it is impossible to effectively supervise the entities corresponding to the token. This point is fundamentally different from traditional financial exchanges. National exchanges have the power of law to force projects to correspond to real objects.

So, how is the aforementioned "capitalism-based" cryptocurrency issued? I named this cryptocurrency the Glorious Community Coin. Glorious Community Coin will be issued with the simplest and mature blockchain technology---Ethereum ERC20. The issuance plan is open to the world, because it is impossible for any individual to achieve the success of Glorious Community Coin based on capitalism. In my opinion, based on capitalist financial operations and the participation of capitalists, Glorious Community Coin will soon become a Bitcoin catcher, or even surpass Bitcoin.

The strict limit number of Glorious Community Coin issued is 30,000,001. I will only keep one Glorious Community Coin on this project, and then give the rest of 30,000,000 coins to people who share the same vision and are willing to manage it. I want to add that, Glorious Community Coin is my pursuit of academic ideals, and I do not expect to rely on Glorious Community Coin to chase wealth. Because the wealth of this life means nothing to me, and this Glorious Community Coin can be seen as one of my dream-complete plans for self-actualization: make it possible for children living in the poverty all over the world to receive the best education. They see the world, while the world sees them.

I have read a large number of white papers and found that most of them spent a lot of time explaining the blockchain technology. This is really putting the cart before the horse. I have already explained above that blockchain technology is nothing more than a system that supports cryptocurrency issuance. Basically 99% of the white paper content is full of supernatural or advanced tech with exaggerated propaganda and irrational financial logic implementation plans. In contrary, I will only discuss the operation method of Glorious Community Coin in the simplest and clearest financial logic. If the capitalists agree with me, then warmly welcome you to contribute a glorious future for next generations.

The rules for 30,000,001 Glorious Community Coin:
1. The unit of the Glorious Community Coin is 2 digits after the decimal point, so to make transaction more conveniently.
2.The distribution ratio of Glorious Community Coin is:
12,000,000 coins are held by capitalists and investment institutions, subscribed through institutions.
11,000,000 coins are minted into 11 coins with collectible value, each of which stores 1 million Glorious Community Coin with no split trading is allowed, and will be auctioned at Sotheby's Auction House for 11 years from the following year.
4,500,000 coins will go for the public in global initial coin offering
1,500,000 coins are held by a charitable foundation and will be released at the rate of 3/10000 daily from the following year.
1,000,000 coins are held by the operating team foundation and released at the rate of 3/10000 a day after operating the project.
Note: The Glorious Community Coin Operation Team Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the Foundation) is established to promote the entire Glorious Community Coin program. The work of the Foundation is equivalent to managing funds for capital operations, enlarging the rate of return, and implementing the above operations. The management board of the foundation will be formed by the holders who have 1 million Glorious Community Coin in a single address. In order to further reflect the fairness of decision-making and the original intention of Glorious Community Coin to change the world, the educational charity under the Glorious Community Coin system will be permanently held one vote within the foundation management board. If there is an even vote between the two sides, the charity will have one more vote.

Subscription plan

Glorious Community Coin will conduct the first round of subscription of 12,000,000 for international professional institutional investors or family funds. With 100,000 coins as a board lot, and each coin 10 US dollars, a total of 120 board lots will be shared by international capitalists. And there is a six to one year lock-up period. At this stage, a total of 120 million dollars was deposited into the USDT receiving address of Glorious Community Coin. 

the Glorious Community Coin Foundation will commission the world ¡¯s top design companies and jewelers to customize 12 pieces of Glorious Community Coin in the second year. The first one is given to the educational charity under the system, and the remaining 11 Glorious Community Coin jewels each contains 1 million Glorious Community Coin. The Foundation will list the Ethereum addresses of Glorious Community Coin contained in the 12 Glorious Community Coin jewelry for public inspection. Every year Glorious Community Coin will commission high-end auction notaries such as Sotheby's to host a Glorious Community Coin jewelry auction called G12, which will auction one piece each year for 11 years. Proceeds from the auction will be deposited into the total Ethereum address of the Glorious Community Coin. 

Glorious Community Coin will conduct a second round of  4,500,000 coins subscriptions on the exchange. Apply for a three-week Glorious Community Coin subscription application using the stock open offer model. The listing price is 15 ~ 25 USD, which can be adjusted according to market conditions. The lottery and listing price will be announced one day before the official launch of the transaction. The subscription process is as follows:
(1) Investor subscription (three-week subscription period): The investor pays the subscription amount in full within the subscription time and conducts the subscription entrustment.
(2) Fund freezing (the first day after the subscription period): The designated exchange will freeze the subscription funds.
(3) Capital verification and numbering (the second day after the subscription period): The exchange will allocate a number for every 100 Glorious Community Coins (the board lot, which can be floated upwards according to the situation) according to the final valid subscription amount. The exchange will automatically and uniformly allocate valid and effective subscriptions.
(4) Lottery (the third day after the purchase period): Announce the winning rate, and organize the lottery according to the total number of allocations and the lottery odds of winning,  and announce the results of the lottery the next day.
(5) Announce the winning number and unfreeze the funds (the fourth day after the purchase period): Unfreeze the purchase money without the lottery lucky numbers.

Charity
Glorious Community Coin will make a huge contribution to world education reform with the concept of distributed commerce. Five percent of the total amount of Glorious Community Coin will be used as a contribution from capital to society. 1.5 million Glorious Community Coin will be giving back to the community gradually over 10 years, helping to establish an online education system in different languages, including courses from kindergarten to university and parenting education. According to Poor Economics  co-authored by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, poverty has been with us for thousands of years. If we intend to eradicate poverty in 50 or 100 years, we need Act quickly. The next generation of the 865 million poor people in the world (average daily income is less than 99 cents) can eradicate the nature of poverty only by obtaining quality education-"Poor people often lack information sources and believe in the wrong things ".

The Glorious Community Coin is born in response to my call for Poor Economics and I also believe that only education can improve the poor's helpless and miserable life. In the post-Internet era, the cost of smart phones, smart TVs and networks has been further reduced. In the long run, at the same time cost, a teacher who teaches at school can only serve dozens of students, but an Internet teacher can educate millions of students. Online education enables students to obtain the best quality educational resources at the lowest cost. I am not disrespect the value of face-to-face teaching, but when we face countries like India with very low levels of education, how many teachers do we need to go into the countryside to improve national education level? NGOs in all countries are adopting Internet education and have helped poverty alleviation in backward areas. Therefore, Glorious Community Coin is also willing to work with those non-profit organizations around the world to complete the great mission of education popularization. Of course, this is also a test for capitalists. I will not be surprised if this part will be deleted when the plan launches the market. But no matter what, I still have a bit of expectation for the goodness of human nature. For capitalists, advancing philanthropy is like setting up a university foundation. But this time it's not about avoiding high estate taxes, but about doing a great thing for the world. Please entrust a team with a sense of mission to complete this great reform in education, which is also my only entrustment.

I have a dream, but I cannot change the world by my own. But with the power of capital, we can jointly create a beautiful world.




Profit model
In the end you may ask, why does Glorious Community Coin have room for continued appreciation? The answer is that Glorious Community Coin itself is a blockchain investment bank listed on Ethereum.
This investment bank account book is open to the entire network, and the address where the Glorious Community Coin deposits USDT is available for inspection throughout the network. Every link only accepts the input and expenditure of USDT. Members of the Glorious Community Coin Management Committee will determine how to use these USDT funds through voting. Capitalists who hold 1 million Glorious Community Coin in a single address will participate in voting. Glorious Community Coin holders' USDT will be managed in a distributed way, including but not limited to the following:
1. Manage Glorious Community Coin market value
2. Entrusted a large number of global quantitative trading institutions for asset management
3. Invest in exchanges with existing or potential value and share their profits
4. Establish cryptocurrency futures and leveraged trading projects
5. Angel Investment Fund accepts bids for global blockchain plans to incubate gifted projects
6. Periodically report on each cryptocurrency, targeted shorts or longs 
7. Implement Glorious Community Coin release on schedule for Charity education programs
8. Carry out Glorious Community Coin release on schedule for core management team
Capital is the power r> g, and the funds collected by the project can be regarded as equivalent capital power to earn high profits. Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi banker, once met Sofia, a young impoverished mother, who made a living on a bamboo bench every day. She borrowed money from usury to buy bamboo, and the processed bamboo stools only made 2 cents after paying off the debt. Seeing this, Muhammad Yunus promised to lend US $ 1 to Sofia without interest, and pay back the money after the bamboo stools were sold. Sofia was able to create US $ 2 from this US $ 1 and earn another US $ 1. The power of capital determines the income of a woman from 0.02 to 1, which is close to 50 times!
When the Glorious Community Coin capital is assembled, so will the generous returns delivered to the capitalist-based foundation for capital operations.
 Glorious Community Coin is based on capitalist thinking in all aspects, and is in the process of conducting a blockchain financial revolution for capitalists. Now only one or some visionary capitalists are required to launch the above plan, Glorious Community Coin will surely become the first blockchain investment bank listed in human history.

Finally, I hereby predict that through capital operations, Glorious Community Coin will definitely be "beyond Bitcoin"! May God¡¯s wisdom and blessings with this plan, always.

Best wishes,
David Ricardo
