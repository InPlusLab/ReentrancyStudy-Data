Simple Agreement for Future Tokens
This Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (this “Agreement”) is entered into on between WT Limited (the “Company”) and (the “Buyer”) in connection with Company’s creation and distribution of the L&#237;f blockchain token (“Project Token”) in furtherance of the establishment and operation of a B2B marketplace for travel inventory called Winding Tree, as described in the White Paper.
Please note that the agreement below only concerns the pre-sale token allocation and not the the Token Distribution Event, which will have its own rules, described in Exhibit A.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above, Company and Buyer hereby agree as follows:

Person: an individual or legal entity or person, including a government or political subdivision or an agency or instrumentality thereof.
Project: the blockchain-enabled network and/or decentralized consensus project being developed by Company that will utilize the Project Token as native to its operations and/or functioning.
Project Founders: Maksim Izmaylov, Jakub Vysoky, Augusto Lemble, Pedro Anderson.
Project Plan: the plan containing a detailed overview of major milestones to be achieved and approximate dates of execution and launch of the blockchain-enabled network of the Project.
Project Token: L&#237;f blockchain token, i.e. an ERC20 blockchain token created in connection with and native to the Project with the characteristics described in the Token Characteristics Document and distributed via (i) a Token Distribution Event and/or (ii) a methodology described in the Token Distribution Plan.
Project Token Protocol: a blockchain based protocol aiming at providing a decentralized B2B marketplace for travel inventory called Winding Tree.
Purchase Price: as defined in Section 2.
TGE: Token Generating Event taking place on November 1st, 2017.

Token Distribution Event: the intended offering of Project Tokens to the general public or other specified investors as the case may be.
Token Distribution Plan: attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Token Price: price of one Project Token.
White Paper: the technical document drafted and published by Company explaining the Project and its components, including the Project Plan and technical characteristics of the Project. Attached hereto as Exhibit C.
Purchase, Sale and Distribution of Tokens
On the Token Distribution Event, Company shall deliver to Buyer a number of Project Tokens calculated by the following formula:
x=Pt∗(1+b)
where “x” is the number of tokens that the Buyer will receive after the Token Distribution Event, “P” is Purchase Price, “t” is Token Price (determined at the end of the Token Distribution Event) and “b” is Bonus Rate (e.g. 0.1 for 10%).
Example: 100 ETH / 1 ETH * (1 + 0.1) = 110 tokens.
Usage License
Ownership of Project Tokens carries no rights, whether express or implied, other than a limited right (license) to use the Project Token Protocol, if and to the extent the Project Token Protocol has been successfully completed and launched.
In particular, Buyer understands and accepts that Project Tokens do not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights nor any right to receive future revenues, shares or any other form of participation or governance right in or relating to the Project Token Protocol and/or the Project Tokens.
By transferring ETH to Company and/or receiving Project Tokens, no form of partnership, joint venture or any similar relationship between the Buyer and Company is created.
Risks
The Buyer understands and accepts the risks in connection with making a Contribution to Company and creating Project Tokens. In particular, but not concluding, the Buyer understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter as well as in the Contribution Terms, which will be handed over to Buyer:
Risk of software weaknesses: The Buyer understands and accepts that the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven, why there is no warranty that the process for creating Project Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH and/or Project Tokens.
Regulatory risk: The Buyer understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the Smart Contract System and/or the Project Token Protocol, including its termination and the loss of Project Tokens for the Buyer.
Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The Buyer understands and accepts that the creation of the Project Tokens and the development of the Project Token Protocol may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The Buyer therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the Project Token Protocol is partially or fully developed and launched, the Buyer will receive any benefits through the Project Tokens held by him.
Risk of withdrawing partners: The Buyer understands and accepts that the TGE and the feasibility of the Project as a whole depends strongly on the collaboration of banks and other crucial partners of Company. The Buyer therefore understands that there is no assurance that TGE will take place as foreseen or the Project as a whole will be successfully executed.
Risk associated with other applications: The Buyer understands and accepts that the Project Token Protocol may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which Project Tokens will have no intrinsic value.
Risk of loss of private key: Project Tokens can only be accessed by using an Ethereum Wallet with a combination of Buyer’s account information (address), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. The Buyer understands and accepts that if his private key file or password respectively got lost or stolen, the obtained Project Tokens associated with the Buyer&#39;s account (address) or password will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.
Risk of theft: The Buyer understands and accepts that the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that could result in theft or loss of Project Tokens or ETH.
Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: The Buyer understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System, expected proper execution and sequencing of Project Token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.
Token Liquidity. Buyer understands that with regard to Project Tokens no market liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value (if any) of Project Tokens over time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate resulting in full and total loss that will be borne exclusively by Buyer with respect to the Project Tokens Buyer purchases under this Agreement.
Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The Buyer understands and accepts, that the Wallet or Wallet service provider used for the contribution, has to be technically compatible with the Project Token. The failure to assure this may have the result that Buyer will not gain access to his Project Token.
Limited Warranties. Except as otherwise set forth herein, in the White Paper, Token Characteristics Document, and/or the Token Distribution Plan, Buyer understands and expressly accepts that there is no warranty whatsoever of the Project Token and/or the success of the Project, expressed or implied, to the extent permitted by law, and that Project Tokens will be created and delivered to Buyer at the sole risk of Buyer on an “as is” and “under development” basis and without, to the extent permitted by law, any warranties of any kind, including, but not limited to, express or implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
Limitations on Recovery. Buyer understands that Buyer has no right against any Company or any other Person to request any refund or redemption of the Purchase Price except as otherwise provided herein and/or as a result of, or in connection with, Company’s breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct.
