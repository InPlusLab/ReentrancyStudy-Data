/**
*	This investment contract accepts investments, which will be sent to the Edgeless ICO contract as soon as it starts buy calling buyTokens().
*     This way investors do not have to buy tokens in time theirselves and still do profit from the power hour offer.
*	Investors may withdraw their funds anytime if they change their mind as long as the tokens have not yet been purchased.
