    What is the BombMoon project about?

    BombMoon is a ERC-20 token created on Ethereum that aims to create a community with equality between owners and members where everyone can achieve financial freedom.


    How will you do that?

    BombMoon strives to be completely decentralized and fully community driven.

    All decisions will be made through community polls which will give BombMoon developers a better idea on how to move forward and which directions to take.

    The team will hold no $BOMB tokens at all and will have to participate in the presale along with all the other investors.


    Who is the team?

    We are a young team of driven entrepreneurs from different fields of work, who got brought together by their passion for technology, Cryptocurrency and blockchain.

    Team members are from different cultures and bring many unique skill-sets that are needed to create, market and manage a cryptocurrency.
