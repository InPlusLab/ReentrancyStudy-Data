/*
* This smart contract implements voting for tokenholders of ERC20 tokens based on the principle
* "one token - one vote"
* It requires external script to count votes.
*
* Rules:
* Voting can be started for any contract with ERC20 tokens, to start a voting an address have to own at lest one token.
* To start a voting, voting creator must provide:
* 1) address of a contract with tokens (ERC20),
* 2) text of the proposal,
* 3) number of block on witch voting will be finished and results have to be calculated.
*
* Every proposal for a contract receives a sequence number that serves as a proposal ID for this contract.
* Each smart contract with tokens has its own numbering.
* So proposal can be identified by contract address with tokens + number (ID) of the proposal.
*
* To vote 'for' or 'against' voter has to provide an address of a contract with tokens + proposal ID.
*
* In most scenarios only votes 'for' can be used, who did not voted 'for' can be considered as voted 'against'.
* But our dApp also supports votes 'against'
*
* To calculate results we collect all voted addresses by an external script, which is also open sourced.
* Than we check their balances in tokens on resulting block, and and sum up the voices.
* Thus, for the results, the number of tokens of the voter at the moment of voting does not matter
* (it should just has at least one).
* What matters is the number of tokens on the voter's address on the block where the results should calculated.
*
