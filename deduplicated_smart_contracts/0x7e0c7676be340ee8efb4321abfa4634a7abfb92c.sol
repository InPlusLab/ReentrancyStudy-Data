Donations of the first round will be weighted twice as much compared to later donations.

The received Ether funds will not be accessible during the donation period.
Donated Eth can be retrieved only after the donation rounds are over and the set unlock timestamp is reached.
In order to never own the funds, the contract owner can set and lock the receiver address beforehand.
The receiver address can be an external account or a distribution contract.

In case destroy() is invoked, they will effectively be burned.
