What is Ethereum Tree?

Ethereum Tree is intelligent platform which works on simple principle of “money tree” – now everyone will earn Ethereum. It is a never ending source of income for those who will invest in the Ethereum Tree. Ethereum Tree grows continuously whenever new investors are added into the Ethereum Tree system.



How Ethereum Tree works?

Anybody willing to invest in Ethereum Tree can start investing with any amount as small as 0.0001 ETH. As name suggests, this platform is completely Ethereum blockchain based system.  After investing into the system person will start earning profit based on the amount of ETH he/she is holding into Ethereum Tree smart contract.



Investors will get income in 2 different ways as explained below:

1.	Income from dividend obtained from successive investments:

Whenever new investor invests Ethereum into Ethereum Tree smart contract (DAPP), system will deduct 10% amount as a network fee which will be distributed to all the investors who are already part of Ethereum Tree.  Distribution amount assigned to each investor is directly proportional to the current holdings of that investor in Ethereum Tree. That means, investors with higher holdings will get larger portion of the dividend (Larger is the holding bigger is the profit). Same thing is illustrated in below image.



2.	Earning from referral bonus:

Ethereum Tree assigns unique referral link to each investor wallet. The format of link is as below:

https://ethereumtree.com/?ref=Your_ETH_Address

Whenever users share this link with his/her friends or relatives to refer them to Ethereum Tree DAPP he/she will get flat 1/3 of 10% network fee from the referral’s investment as a referral bonus. This means, whenever referred person invests 10% amount is deducted as a network fee for distribution amongst the present members of the Ethereum Tree but 1/3 part of that deducted amount will be directly given to referring person as a referral bonus and remaining 2/3 portion will be distributed amongst all the members of the Ethereum Tree based on current holdings. So, person who refers other members to the system will get double benefits (referral bonus as well as future dividend on referential bonus).



Benefits of using Ethereum Tree as an investment option:

•	Investors get dividend amount from successive investors based on their current holdings in the system. So investor can increase their holdings to get more and more profit out of it.

•	Ethereum Tree is highly secure distributed system so no one controls it but the investors. So all the investments of investors are safe into the system (Ethereum blockchain).

•	Investors can withdraw their holdings including profits earned via dividend and referral bonus anytime as per their need.

•	Investor can earn unlimited profits by referring more and more members to the Ethereum Tree. User who refers other members will get benefits from both referral bonus as well as future dividend on referential bonus.

•	The best thing about Ethereum Tree is that the investors get profit based on percentage of total holdings which they have in Ethereum Tree. Holdings go on increasing with newly added members in the system and investor’s income from dividend also starts increasing.



Admin can't do below things:

1. Withdraw funds from Ethereum Tree Contract

2. Modify EthereumTree contract



Admin can do:

1. Invest in EthereumTree

2. Pay promoter from admin account. This will be deducted from admin investment in Ethereum Tree.
