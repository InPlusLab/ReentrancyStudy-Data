/**
 * @title UTN-P ERC20 token by Universa Blockchain.
 *
 * @dev Based on OpenZeppelin framework.
 *
 * Features:
 *
 * * ERC20 compatibility, with token details as properties.
 * * total supply: 4997891952 (initially given to the contract author).
 * * decimals: 18
 * * BurnableToken: some addresses are allowed to burn tokens.
 * * “third-party smart contract trading protection”: transferFrom/approve/allowance methods are present but do nothing.
 * * TimeLock: implemented externally (in TokenTimelock contract), some tokens are time-locked for 3 months.
 * * Bulk send: implemented externally (in BulkSender contract), some tokens are time-locked for 3 months.
