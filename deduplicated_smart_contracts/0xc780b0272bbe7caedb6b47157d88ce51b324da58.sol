    我裼昧祟交易所的架，F了o手mM、不需要CPUY源的O速w。同r我的_Y果裼昧EOS^K哈希，投注Y果通^EOSD~的形式同步在EOS上。

    保C了下注信息公_透明，可查。_Y果公平透明，可查。K且得益於@N架，我可以支持多欧N，跨欧N的投注。是^K首的Dapp解Q方案。

    然而各大Dapp排行W站需要通^合s地址跟踪我的流水情r，因此特e建立此合s，真映射我的投注流水情r。大家可以通^追踪官方W站公训EOS~舻霓D~MEMO，核α魉（每半小rR一次）。

    本合s不ν忾_放，勿{用.



    We adopted a class-like exchange architecture to achieve a speed-free experience with no fees and no CPU resources.

    At the same time, our lottery results use the EOS block hash, and the betting results are recorded on the EOS in the form of EOS transfer.

    The betting information is guaranteed to be transparent and identifiable. The results of the lottery are fair and transparent and can be checked.

    And thanks to this architecture, we can support multi-currency, cross-chain currency betting. It is the first Dapp solution in the blockchain.

    However, the major Dapp ranking websites need to track our flow status through the contract address, so this contract is specially established to truly map our betting flow.

    You can check the data (summary every half hour) by tracking the transfer record MEMO of the EOS account published on the official website.

    This contract is not open to the public, please do not call
