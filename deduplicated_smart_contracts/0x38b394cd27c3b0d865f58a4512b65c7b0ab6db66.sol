//A BurnableOpenPayment is instantiated with a specified payer and a serviceDeposit.
//The worker is not set when the contract is instantiated.

//The constructor is payable, so the contract can be instantiated with initial funds.
//In addition, anyone can add more funds to the Payment by calling addFunds.

//All behavior of the contract is directed by the payer, but
//the payer can never directly recover the payment,
//unless he calls the recover() function before anyone else commit()s.

//If the BOP is in the Open state,
//anyone can become the worker by contributing the serviceDeposit with commit().
//This changes the state from Open to Committed. The BOP will never return to the Open state.
//The worker will never be changed once it&#39;s been set via commit().

//In the committed state,
//the payer can at any time choose to burn or release to the worker any amount of funds.
