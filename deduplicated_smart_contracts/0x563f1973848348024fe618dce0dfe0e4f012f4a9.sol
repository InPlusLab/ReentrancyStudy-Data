@title TokenIOStorage - Serves as derived contract for TokenIO contract and

is used to upgrade interfaces in the event of deprecating the main contract.



@author Ryan Tate <[email protected]>, Sean Pollock <[email protected]>



@notice Storage contract



@dev In the event that the main contract becomes deprecated, the upgraded contract

will be set as the owner of this contract, and use this contract's storage to

maintain data consistency between contract.



@notice NOTE: This contract is based on the RocketPool Storage Contract,

found here: https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/blob/master/contracts/RocketStorage.sol

And this medium article: https://medium.com/rocket-pool/upgradable-solidity-contract-design-54789205276d



Changes:

 - setting primitive mapping view to internal;

 - setting method views to public;



 @dev NOTE: When deprecating the main TokenIO contract, the upgraded contract

 must take ownership of the TokenIO contract, it will require using the public methods

 to update changes to the underlying data. The updated contract must use a

 standard call to original TokenIO contract such that the  request is made from

 the upgraded contract and not the transaction origin (tx.origin) of the signing

 account.





 @dev NOTE: The reasoning for using the storage contract is to abstract the interface

 from the data of the contract on chain, limiting the need to migrate data to

 new contracts.
