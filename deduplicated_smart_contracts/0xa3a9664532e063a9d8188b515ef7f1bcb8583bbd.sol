Unless you make yourself publicly known by stating your name on the post, no additional information will be stored in terms of your identity. You should know that, ultimately, there may be ways to track the wallet address back to you, although this is very difficult and there are no easy ways to perform this action. The fact that you accepted these terms will be stored as your first post on the blockchain, as proof that we made you aware of the risks.
