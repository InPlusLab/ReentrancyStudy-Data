// DSProxyCache
// This global cache stores addresses of contracts previously deployed
// by a proxy. This saves gas from repeat deployment of the same
// contracts and eliminates blockchain bloat.

// By default, all proxies deployed from the same factory store
// contracts in the same cache. The cache a proxy instance uses can be
// changed.  The cache uses the sha3 hash of a contract's bytecode to
// lookup the address
