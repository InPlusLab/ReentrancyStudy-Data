/**
 * @title Owned
 *
 * This contract keeps and transfers contract ownership.
 *
 * After deployment msg.sender becomes an owner which is checked in modifier onlyContractOwner().
 *
 * Features:
 * Modifier onlyContractOwner() restricting access to function for all callers except the owner.
 * Functions of transferring ownership to another address.
 *
 * Note:
 * Function forceChangeContractOwnership allows to
 * transfer the ownership to an address without confirmation.
 * Which is very convenient in case the ownership transfers to a contract.
 * But when using this function, it's important to be very careful when entering the address.
 * Check address three times to make sure that this is the address that you need
 * because you can't cancel this operation.
