CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A contract with an owner, that can push arbitrary data to be emitted
as an event.

The intention of this contract is to post a merkle tree root hash of
a group of events, to ensure that data from an external source can
be validated as having not been altered.

A contract with an owner, to be inherited by other contracts.
Requires its owner to be explicitly set in the constructor.
Provides an onlyOwner access modifier.

To change owner, the current owner must nominate the next owner,
who then has to accept the nomination. The nomination can be
cancelled before it is accepted by the new owner by having the
previous owner change the nomination (setting it to 0).

If the ownership is to be relinquished, then it can be handed
to a smart contract whose only function is to accept that
ownership, which guarantees no owner-only functionality can
ever be invoked.
