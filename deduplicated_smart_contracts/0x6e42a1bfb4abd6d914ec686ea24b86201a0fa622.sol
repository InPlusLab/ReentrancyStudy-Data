 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow

 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an

d) Calculator addresses are mutable:

// This contract has the power to change SODA allocation among
// different pools, but can't mint more than 100,000 SODA tokens.
// With ALL_BLOCKS_AMOUNT and SODA_PER_BLOCK,
// we have 100,000 * 1 = 100,000
//
// For the remaining 900,000 SODA, we will need to deploy a new contract called
// CreateMoreSoda after the community can make a decision by voting.
//
// Currently this contract is the only owner of SodaToken and is itself owned by
// Timelock, and it has a function transferToCreateMoreSoda to transfer the
// ownership to CreateMoreSoda once all the 100,000 tokens are out.
