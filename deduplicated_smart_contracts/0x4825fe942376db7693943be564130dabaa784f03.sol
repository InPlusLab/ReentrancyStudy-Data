MODULE DESCRIPTION

-----------------------------------------------------------------



This contract exists to manage multi-sig functionality for

Free PlayChips.



It is a simple ERC20 token with additional functionality to send

batched transfers and approvals. This way transactions can be

made in bulk, saving time and gas.



The contract can be paused by the owner so that transfers are

disabled until it is unpaused. The contract begins paused

so that during this initialisation phase, all tokens are to

be distributed by the deployer of the contract.



The contract can also be self-destructed by the owner after a

four week delay after announcing the self-destruction. Note

that pausing the contract will do nothing during the

self-destruction period.

MODULE DESCRIPTION

-----------------------------------------------------------------



A contract with an owner, to be inherited by other contracts.

Requires its owner to be explicitly set in the constructor.

Provides an onlyOwner access modifier.



To change owner, the current owner must nominate the next owner,

who then has to accept the nomination. The nomination can be

cancelled before it is accepted by the new owner by having the

previous owner change the nomination (setting it to 0).



If the ownership is to be relinquished, then it can be handed

to a smart contract whose only function is to accept that

ownership, which guarantees no owner-only functionality can

ever be invoked.
