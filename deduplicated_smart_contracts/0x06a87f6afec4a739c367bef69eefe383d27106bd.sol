 Scoobi-Doge Token Contract

 A real decentralized community token with 100% tokens in starting Uniswap supply and locked away for 10 years, no minting functions.
 Further information on https://github.com/Scoobi-doge/Scoobi-doge.github.io
 BTW Scoobi-Doge really is a cool dog breed, and arguably the strongest.

 Symbol        : SCooBi
 Name          : Scoobi-Doge
 Total supply  : 100000000000
 Decimals      : 18
 Deployer Account : 0xA1c71DD36b10009012B01b9e82f9b749286F12c6

 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
