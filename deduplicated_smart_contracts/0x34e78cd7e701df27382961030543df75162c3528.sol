* ETH CRYPTOCURRENCY DISTRIBUTION PROJECT v 3.0

* Web              - https://3333eth.ru

* 

* 

*  - GAIN 3,33% - 1% PER 24 HOURS (interest is charges in equal parts every 10 min)

*  - Life-long payments

*  - The revolutionary reliability

*  - Minimal contribution 0.01 eth

*  - Currency and payment - ETH

*  - Contribution allocation schemes:

*    -- 87% payments

*    --  8% marketing

*    --  5% technical support

*

*   ---About the Project

*  Blockchain-enabled smart contracts have opened a new era of trustless relationships without 

*  intermediaries. This technology opens incredible financial possibilities. Our automated investment 

*  distribution model is written into a smart contract, uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain and can be 

*  freely accessed online. In order to insure our investors' complete security, full control over the 

*  project has been transferred from the organizers to the smart contract: nobody can influence the 

*  system's permanent autonomous functioning.

* 

* RECOMMENDED GAS LIMIT: 200000

* RECOMMENDED GAS PRICE: https://ethgasstation.info/

* You can check the payments on the etherscan.io site, in the "Internal Txns" tab of your wallet.

* 

* ---It is not allowed to transfer from exchanges, only from your personal ETH wallet, for which you 

* have private keys.

* 

* Contracts reviewed and approved by pros!

 * @title SafeMath

 * @dev Math operations with safety checks that throw on error
