/*
    HolyHand is a transfer proxy contract for ERC20 and ETH transfers through Holyheld infrastructure (deposit/withdraw to HolyPool, swaps, etc.)
    - extract fees;
    - call token conversion if needed;
    - deposit/withdraw tokens into HolyPool;
    - non-custodial, not holding any funds;
    - fees are accumulated on this contract's balance (if fees enabled);

    This contract is a single address that user grants allowance to on any ERC20 token for interacting with HH services.
    This contract could be upgraded in the future to provide subsidized transactions using bonuses from treasury.

    TODO: if token supports permit, provide ability to execute without separate approval call

    V2 version additions:
    - direct deposits to pool (if no fees or conversions);
    - when swapping tokens direct return converted asset to sender (if no fees);
    - ETH support (non-wrapped ETH conversion for deposits and swaps);
    - emergencyTransfer can reclaim ETH
