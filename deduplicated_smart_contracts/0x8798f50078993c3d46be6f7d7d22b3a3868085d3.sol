//Purpose: PantherCoin is the next step in the process of rebalancing the economic scales worldwide, returning wealth to the hands of the oppressed (more on that below) and providing a means for frictionless international and interpersonal commerce between people normally deprived of such benefits.
//The Promise: 10% or more of all funds the creator of PantherCoin receives will be invested in or donated to black empowerment & education causes, black people in need anywhere in the world.  Beyond that baseline promise, PantherCoin proceeds will also be used to begin exploring options and opportunities for providing black people across the globe with an international home, just as jewish people and other ethnicities have.  Get ready.
//Who am I?  My name is Zeaun Zarrieff, and I&#39;m here to help.
