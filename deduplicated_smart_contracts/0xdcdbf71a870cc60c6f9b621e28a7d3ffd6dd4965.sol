    // `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by
    // calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning
    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
    //
    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.
    // Contracts calling view functions in the Vault must make sure the Vault has not already been entered.

    // Swaps
    //
    // Users can swap tokens with Pools by calling the `swap` and `batchSwap` functions. To do this,
    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.

// This library is used to create a data structure that represents a token's balance for a Pool. 'cash' is how many
// tokens the Pool has sitting inside of the Vault. 'managed' is how many tokens were withdrawn from the Vault by the
// Pool's Asset Manager. 'total' is the sum of these two, and represents the Pool's total token balance, including
// tokens that are *not* inside of the Vault.
//
// 'cash' is updated whenever tokens enter and exit the Vault, while 'managed' is only updated if the reason tokens are
// moving is due to an Asset Manager action. This is reflected in the different methods available: 'increaseCash'
// and 'decreaseCash' for swaps and add/remove liquidity events, and 'cashToManaged' and 'managedToCash' for events
// transferring funds to and from the Asset Manager.
//
// The Vault disallows the Pool's 'cash' from becoming negative. In other words, it can never use any tokens that are
// not inside the Vault.
//
// One of the goals of this library is to store the entire token balance in a single storage slot, which is why we use
// 112 bit unsigned integers for 'cash' and 'managed'. For consistency, we also disallow any combination of 'cash' and
// 'managed' that yields a 'total' that doesn't fit in 112 bits.
//
// The remaining 32 bits of the slot are used to store the most recent block when the total balance changed. This
// can be used to implement price oracles that are resilient to 'sandwich' attacks.
//
// We could use a Solidity struct to pack these three values together in a single storage slot, but unfortunately
// Solidity only allows for structs to live in either storage, calldata or memory. Because a memory struct still takes
// up a slot in the stack (to store its memory location), and because the entire balance fits in a single stack slot
// (two 112 bit values plus the 32 bit block), using memory is strictly less gas performant. Therefore, we do manual
// packing and unpacking.
//
// Since we cannot define new types, we rely on bytes32 to represent these values instead, as it doesn't have any
// associated arithmetic operations and therefore reduces the chance of misuse.

 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
