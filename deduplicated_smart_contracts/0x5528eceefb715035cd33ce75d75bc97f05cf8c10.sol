 * @title DharmaReserveManagerV3 (staging version)
 * @author 0age
 * @notice This contract is owned by the Dharma Reserve Manager multisig and
 * manages Dharma's reserves. It designates a collection of "roles" - these are
 * dedicated accounts that can be modified by the owner, and that can trigger
 * specific functionality on the manager. These roles are:
 *  - depositManager (0): initiates token transfers to smart wallets
 *  - adjuster (1): mints / redeems Dai, and swaps USDC, for dDai
 *  - withdrawalManager (2): initiates usdc transfers to a recipient set by owner
 *  - pauser (3): pauses any role (only the owner is then able to unpause it)
 *
 * When finalizing deposits, the deposit manager must adhere to two constraints:
 *  - it must provide "proof" that the recipient is a smart wallet by including
 *    the initial user signing key used to derive the smart wallet address
 *  - it must not attempt to transfer more Dai, or more than the Dai-equivalent
 *    value of Dharma Dai, than the current "limit" set by the owner.
 *
 * Reserves can be retrieved via `getReserves`, the current limit can be
 * retrieved via `getLimit`, and "proofs" can be validated via `isSmartWallet`.
