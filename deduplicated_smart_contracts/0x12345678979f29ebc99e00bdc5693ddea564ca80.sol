// Treasury responsibilities:

//  - storing the mapping of token codes to token contract addresses

//  - processing deposits to/withdrawals from/transfers between token accounts within itself

//  - processing emergency releases



// Treasury is required because Counter is not a wallet-to-wallet exchange, and requires deposits and

// withdrawals in order to be able to trade. Having full control over settlement order enables Counter

// to be responsive on its UI by settling trades and withdrawals in background. The former

// operations are authorized by ECDSA signatures collected from users and effected on-chain by the

// Counter arbiter services.



// Because user signatures are effected on the contract via an intermediary (the Counter arbiter),

// there is inherent trust issue where a trader may assume that the Counter may refuse to apply some

// operations on-chain (especially withdrawals), or may simply experience prolonged downtime. Hence

// the need for the emergency release (ER) feature, which is an ability to withdraw funds from Counter

// directly. It works as follows:

//  1) any trader may initiate a cooldown of two days for all token accounts of the same address

//  2) this cooldown is reset by invoking withdrawal or exchange on this address - these are the

//     operations which require explicit consent in the form of digital signature and thus mean

//     that a) exchange is operational b) the user trusts it

//  3) in case the cooldown have not been reset by any means within two day period, the user may withdraw

//     the entirety of their funds from Treasury.

//

// A note should be made regarding 2) - Counter does _not_ have an ability to reset the ER cooldown

// arbitrarily long, as trade signatures contain an explicit expiration date, and withdrawals have a

// nonce which makes them eligible to be applied once.
