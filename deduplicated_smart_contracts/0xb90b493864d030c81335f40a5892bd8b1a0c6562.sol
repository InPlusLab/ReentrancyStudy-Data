    //              details of the offers that get created, cancelled, overbid, expired, and fulfilled,

    //              as well as the fee structure that the offers will be operating with.

    //              operations that can be executed only by specific roles. The roles are: CEO, CFO,

    //              COO, and LostAndFound. Additionally, this contract exposes functions for the CFO
