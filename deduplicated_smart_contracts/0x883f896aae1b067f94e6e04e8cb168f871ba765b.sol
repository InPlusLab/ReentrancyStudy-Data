/**

 * @dev Implementation of the `IERC20` interface.

 *

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.

 * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.

 *

 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply

 * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*

 *

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead

 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional

 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.

 *

 * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.

 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just

 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit

 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

 *

 * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`

 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting

 * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.
