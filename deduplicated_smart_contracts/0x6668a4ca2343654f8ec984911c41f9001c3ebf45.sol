 * Easy Investment Ideal Contract

 *  - GAIN UP TO 24% PER 24 HOURS (every 5900 blocks)

 *

 * How to use:

 *  1. Send any amount of Ether to make an investment

 *  2a. Claim your profit by sending 0 Ether transaction (every day, every

 *      week, I don't care unless you're spending too much on GAS)

 *  OR

 *  2b. Send more Ether to reinvest AND get your profit at the same time

 * 

 * Rules:

 *  1. You cannot withdraw more than 90% of fund

 *  2. Funds from the fund cannot be withdrawn within a week after the

 *     launch of the contract

 *  3. Those who join the project with a deposit of at least 0.1 Etner

 *     during the first week after launch become premium users and

 *     receive a percentage of one and a half times more

 *     (maximum - 24% instead of 16%)

 *  4. If you invest or reinvest not less than 1 Ether, your percentage

 *     immediately rises to the maximum

 *  5. With each reinvestment of less than 1 Ether (or just when

 *     withdrawing funds), the percentage decreases by 1%

 *  6. Minimum percentage - 2%

 *

 * RECOMMENDED GAS LIMIT: 200000
