/**
 * The Edgeless blackjack contract only allows calls from the authorized casino proxy contracts. 
 * The proxy contract only forward moves if called by an authorized wallet owned by the Edgeless casino, but the game
 * data has to be signed by the player to show his approval. This way, Edgeless can provide a fluid game experience
 * without having to wait for transaction confirmations.
