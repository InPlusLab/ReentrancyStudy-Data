A proxy contract that, if it does not recognise the function
being called on it, passes all value and call data to an
underlying target contract.
 
This proxy has the capacity to toggle between DELEGATECALL
and CALL style proxy functionality.
 
The former executes in the proxy's context, and so will preserve
msg.sender and store data at the proxy address. The latter will not.
Therefore, any contract the proxy wraps in the CALL style must
implement the Proxyable interface, in order that it can pass msg.sender
into the underlying contract as the state parameter, messageSender.

MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
This provides the nomin contract with a confiscation
facility, if enough havven owners vote to confiscate a target
account's nomins.
 
This is designed to provide a mechanism to respond to abusive
contracts such as nomin wrappers, which would allow users to
trade wrapped nomins without accruing fees on those transactions.
 
In order to prevent tyranny, an account may only be frozen if
users controlling at least 30% of the value of havvens participate,
and a two thirds majority is attained in that vote.
In order to prevent tyranny of the majority or mob justice,
confiscation motions are only approved if the havven foundation
approves the result.
This latter requirement may be lifted in future versions.
 
The foundation, or any user with a sufficient havven balance may
bring a confiscation motion.
A motion lasts for a default period of one week, with a further
confirmation period in which the foundation approves the result.
The latter period may conclude early upon the foundation's decision
to either veto or approve the mooted confiscation motion.
If the confirmation period elapses without the foundation making
a decision, the motion fails.
 
The weight of a havven holder's vote is determined by examining
their average balance over the last completed fee period prior to
the beginning of a given motion.
 
Thus, since a fee period can roll over in the middle of a motion,
we must also track a user's average balance of the last two periods.
This system is designed such that it cannot be attacked by users
transferring funds between themselves, while also not requiring them
to lock their havvens for the duration of the vote. This is possible
since any transfer that increases the average balance in one account
will be reflected by an equivalent reduction in the voting weight in
the other.
 
At present a user may cast a vote only for one motion at a time,
but may cancel their vote at any time except during the confirmation period,
when the vote tallies must remain static until the matter has been settled.
 
A motion to confiscate the balance of a given address composes
a state machine built of the following states:
 
Waiting:
  - A user with standing brings a motion:
    If the target address is not frozen;
    initialise vote tallies to 0;
    transition to the Voting state.
 
  - An account cancels a previous residual vote:
    remain in the Waiting state.
 
Voting:
  - The foundation vetoes the in-progress motion:
    transition to the Waiting state.
 
  - The voting period elapses:
    transition to the Confirmation state.
 
  - An account votes (for or against the motion):
    its weight is added to the appropriate tally;
    remain in the Voting state.
 
  - An account cancels its previous vote:
    its weight is deducted from the appropriate tally (if any);
    remain in the Voting state.
 
Confirmation:
  - The foundation vetoes the completed motion:
    transition to the Waiting state.
 
  - The foundation approves confiscation of the target account:
    freeze the target account, transfer its nomin balance to the fee pool;
    transition to the Waiting state.
 
  - The confirmation period elapses:
    transition to the Waiting state.
 
User votes are not automatically cancelled upon the conclusion of a motion.
Therefore, after a motion comes to a conclusion, if a user wishes to vote
in another motion, they must manually cancel their vote in order to do so.
 
This procedure is designed to be relatively simple.
There are some things that can be added to enhance the functionality
at the expense of simplicity and efficiency:
 
  - Democratic unfreezing of nomin accounts (induces multiple categories of vote)
  - Configurable per-vote durations;
  - Vote standing denominated in a fiat quantity rather than a quantity of havvens;
  - Confiscate from multiple addresses in a single vote;
 
We might consider updating the contract with any of these features at a later date if necessary.

Havven-backed nomin stablecoin contract.
 
This contract issues nomins, which are tokens worth 1 USD each.
 
Nomins are issuable by Havven holders who have to lock up some
value of their havvens to issue H * Cmax nomins. Where Cmax is
some value less than 1.
 
A configurable fee is charged on nomin transfers and deposited
into a common pot, which havven holders may withdraw from once
per fee period.

MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
This contract allows the foundation to apply unique vesting
schedules to havven funds sold at various discounts in the token
sale. HavvenEscrow gives users the ability to inspect their
vested funds, their quantities and vesting dates, and to withdraw
the fees that accrue on those funds.
 
The fees are handled by withdrawing the entire fee allocation
for all havvens inside the escrow contract, and then allowing
the contract itself to subdivide that pool up proportionally within
itself. Every time the fee period rolls over in the main Havven
contract, the HavvenEscrow fee pool is remitted back into the
main fee pool to be redistributed in the next fee period.

MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Havven token contract. Havvens are transferable ERC20 tokens,
and also give their holders the following privileges.
An owner of havvens may participate in nomin confiscation votes, they
may also have the right to issue nomins at the discretion of the
foundation for this version of the contract.
 
After a fee period terminates, the duration and fees collected for that
period are computed, and the next period begins. Thus an account may only
withdraw the fees owed to them for the previous period, and may only do
so once per period. Any unclaimed fees roll over into the common pot for
the next period.
 
== Average Balance Calculations ==
 
The fee entitlement of a havven holder is proportional to their average
issued nomin balance over the last fee period. This is computed by
measuring the area under the graph of a user's issued nomin balance over
time, and then when a new fee period begins, dividing through by the
duration of the fee period.
 
We need only update values when the balances of an account is modified.
This occurs when issuing or burning for issued nomin balances,
and when transferring for havven balances. This is for efficiency,
and adds an implicit friction to interacting with havvens.
A havven holder pays for his own recomputation whenever he wants to change
his position, which saves the foundation having to maintain a pot dedicated
to resourcing this.
 
A hypothetical user's balance history over one fee period, pictorially:
 
      s ____
       |    |
       |    |___ p
       |____|___|___ __ _  _
       f    t   n
 
Here, the balance was s between times f and t, at which time a transfer
occurred, updating the balance to p, until n, when the present transfer occurs.
When a new transfer occurs at time n, the balance being p,
we must:
 
  - Add the area p * (n - t) to the total area recorded so far
  - Update the last transfer time to n
 
So if this graph represents the entire current fee period,
the average havvens held so far is ((t-f)*s + (n-t)*p) / (n-f).
The complementary computations must be performed for both sender and
recipient.
 
Note that a transfer keeps global supply of havvens invariant.
The sum of all balances is constant, and unmodified by any transfer.
So the sum of all balances multiplied by the duration of a fee period is also
constant, and this is equivalent to the sum of the area of every user's
time/balance graph. Dividing through by that duration yields back the total
havven supply. So, at the end of a fee period, we really do yield a user's
average share in the havven supply over that period.
 
A slight wrinkle is introduced if we consider the time r when the fee period
rolls over. Then the previous fee period k-1 is before r, and the current fee
period k is afterwards. If the last transfer took place before r,
but the latest transfer occurred afterwards:
 
k-1       |        k
      s __|_
       |  | |
       |  | |____ p
       |__|_|____|___ __ _  _
          |
       f  | t    n
          r
 
In this situation the area (r-f)*s contributes to fee period k-1, while
the area (t-r)*s contributes to fee period k. We will implicitly consider a
zero-value transfer to have occurred at time r. Their fee entitlement for the
previous period will be finalised at the time of their first transfer during the
current fee period, or when they query or withdraw their fee entitlement.
 
In the implementation, the duration of different fee periods may be slightly irregular,
as the check that they have rolled over occurs only when state-changing havven
operations are performed.
 
== Issuance and Burning ==
 
In this version of the havven contract, nomins can only be issued by
those that have been nominated by the havven foundation. Nomins are assumed
to be valued at $1, as they are a stable unit of account.
 
All nomins issued require a proportional value of havvens to be locked,
where the proportion is governed by the current issuance ratio. This
means for every $1 of Havvens locked up, $(issuanceRatio) nomins can be issued.
i.e. to issue 100 nomins, 100/issuanceRatio dollars of havvens need to be locked up.
 
To determine the value of some amount of havvens(H), an oracle is used to push
the price of havvens (P_H) in dollars to the contract. The value of H
would then be: H * P_H.
 
Any havvens that are locked up by this issuance process cannot be transferred.
The amount that is locked floats based on the price of havvens. If the price
of havvens moves up, less havvens are locked, so they can be issued against,
or transferred freely. If the price of havvens moves down, more havvens are locked,
even going above the initial wallet balance.
