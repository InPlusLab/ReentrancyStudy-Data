Who and what is PullBack?
PULLBACK is programmed to reward HODLers while increasing in both liquidity and value.
It does this by applying a 10% tax on transactions; 5% goes to HODLers, 5% is auto-locked to liquidity.
FOREVER DEFLATIONARY SUPPLY.
We burned 30% of the total supply after launch, and sent it to a black hole address.
As this address also participates in the protocol, it accumulates more tokens,
thereby effectively removing them from circulation. There is no limit to the burn; the black hole will continue to grow,
increasing the scarcity of PULLBACK.

WHY 30%?
This part makes PULLBACK hyperdeflationary; the burn address accumulates the most coins during tax distribution.

SAFE LIQUIDITY.
LP tokens are burned, & liquidity is locked forever.

OWNERSHIP RENOUNCED.
No one has control over the token contract, so no malicious actions are possible.

Governance
PULLBACK HODLers will have the right to access our governance system - a platform on which HODLers can vote and make future suggestions.

Charity
We are already planning to set up a charity wallet! We will use the accumulated tax to send to a charity that has been chosen by our community. This will be a periodic thing that we do for different charities as a community.

NFT Farm
In the near future, HODLers will also be able to use the PULLBACK token in order to farm NFTs! Partnerships with various artists are already in the works.


PullBack offers an automated solution for reducing the hassle and time spent on performing complex financial operations, while at the same time keeping your assets secure. It’s based on an access-from-anywhere system in which anyone, with only an internet connection, can benefit from the full freedoms of modern finance.
Even though we’re a private company, PullBack is dedicated to embracing community. So your support, feedback and involvement is crucial to our offering a more valuable, seamless experience.
This is just the beginning of a long journey. We invite everyone to imagine, hope and dream of a new reality through decentralized finance.


Introducing the PullBack Token (PLBK)
We are very excited to share more information about the token economy available on PullBack. As expected, PullBack, bringing a new era of automated finance, will introduce a token in our ecosystem. The ticker will be PLBK and we love to call it “PullBacks”.
Please find below a comprehensive list of questions and answers shedding some light on how the token works. Also, a couple of key points:
There is no token sale at all.
The team has no allocation of PLBK.
PLBK has no value, but a buyback will happen. See details below.
