// Roboto Player One is an on-chain treausre hunt inspired by Ready Player One (the book, not the movie) and a gift to the Robotos community. 

// Hidden in this smart contract is an NFT that only the holder of a randomly chosen Roboto can claim.
// Anyone is free to check if their wallet holds the key Roboto. 0.02 ETH will check if all of your Robotos are the key, whether you have 1 or 100
// ...or you can end the treasure hunt at any time by buying the mystery NFT from the contract for 10 ETH using the `buyout` function. 
// Have fun!
