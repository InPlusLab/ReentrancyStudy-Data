	// We accept payments other than Ethereum (ETH) and other currencies, for example, Bitcoin (BTC).

	// We release tokens on Ethereum. During the pre-ICO and ICO with a smart contract, you directly transfer
	// the tokens there and immediately, with the same transaction, receive tokens in your wallet.

	// When paying in any other currency, for example in BTC, we accept your money via one common wallet.
	// Our manager fixes the amount received for the bitcoin wallet and calls the method of the smart
    // contract paymentsInOtherCurrency to inform him how much foreign currency has been received - on a daily basis.
    // The smart contract pins the number of accepted ETH directly and the number of BTC. Smart contract
    // monitors softcap and hardcap, so as not to go beyond this framework.

	// In theory, it is possible that when approaching hardcap, we will receive a transfer (one or several
	// transfers) to the wallet of BTC, that together with previously received money will exceed the hardcap in total.
	// In this case, we will refund all the amounts above, in order not to exceed the hardcap.

	// Collection of money in BTC will be carried out via one common wallet. The wallet&#39;s address will be published
	// everywhere (in a white paper, on the ICO website, on Telegram, on Bitcointalk, in this code, etc.)
	// Anyone interested can check that the administrator of the smart contract writes down exactly the amount
	// in ETH (in equivalent for BTC) there. In theory, the ability to bypass a smart contract to accept money in
	// BTC and not register them in ETH creates a possibility for manipulation by the company. Thanks to
	// paymentsInOtherCurrency however, this threat is leveled.

	// Any user can check the amounts in BTC and the variable of the smart contract that accounts for this
	// (paymentsInOtherCurrency method). Any user can easily check the incoming transactions in a smart contract
	// on a daily basis. Any hypothetical tricks on the part of the company can be exposed and panic during the ICO,
	// simply pointing out the incompatibility of paymentsInOtherCurrency (ie, the amount of ETH + BTC collection)
	// and the actual transactions in BTC. The company strictly adheres to the described principles of openness.

	// The company administrator is required to synchronize paymentsInOtherCurrency every working day (but you
	// cannot synchronize if there are no new BTC payments). In the case of unforeseen problems, such as
	// brakes on the Ethereum network, this operation may be difficult. You should only worry if the
	// administrator does not synchronize the amount for more than 96 hours in a row, and the BTC wallet
	// receives significant amounts.

	// This scenario ensures that for the sum of all fees in all currencies this value does not exceed hardcap.
