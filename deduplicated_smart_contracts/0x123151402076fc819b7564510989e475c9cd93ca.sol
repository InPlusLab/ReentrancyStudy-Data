     * @notice A function to get the pegout address.
     * 
     * ***WARNING*** any tokens transferred to this address will be destroyed. Please follow the instructions below.
     *
     * This address can be used to transfer wrapped-DGLD tokens from this ethereum contract to the
     * DGLD federated sidechain. Failure to follow the procedure outlined below will result
     * in permanent loss of tokens. Your tokens may then be reminted and returned to you
     * (minus a fee) but this is not guaranteed.
     *
     * Whitelisting must be completed and approved on a DGLD federated sidechain wallet prior to conducting
     * a pegout. Please see the instructions to whitelist your wallet here: https://dgld.ch/wallet-id.
     *
     * PEGOUT INSTRUCTIONS
     * To transfer wrapped-DGLD tokens to an address on the DGLD side chain:
     * 1) Obtain a whitelisted DGLD sidechain address (`receiver` address).
     * 2) Import the `receiver` address private key into an Ethereum wallet in order to generate the corresponding Ethereum account (`sender` account).
     * 3) Transfer the required number of wrapped-DGLD tokens to the sender account.
     * 4) Obtain the pegout address using the pegoutAddress() function.
     * 5) Transfer the required number of tokens from the sender account to the pegout address.
     *
     *
     * ALTERNATIVE PEGOUT INSTRUCTIONS
     * To transfer tokens to an address on the DGLD side chain:
     * 1) Import the private key(s) from an Ethereum account (`sender` account) into a DGLD sidechain wallet. To do this in the DGLD Ocean Wallet version 1.0.2: 
     * In the menu click File -> New. Choose a name for the new wallet and click next. Select 'Import Ocean addresses or private keys' from the list of options
     * and click Next. Enter the list of private keys and click Next. Then ensure that the wallet is whitelisted (instructions to whitelist your wallet here:
     * https://dgld.ch/wallet-id).
     * 2) Transfer the required number of wrapped-DGLD tokens to the sender account.
     * 3) Obtain the pegout address using the pegoutAddress() function.
     * 4) Transfer the required number of tokens from the sender account to the pegout address.
     *
     *
     * 24/7 operational uptime for the service is not guaranteed by the service provider.
