 * @notice This contract is owned by Dharma and used to facilitate peer-to-peer
 * payments on the platform. It designates a collection of "roles" - these
 * are dedicated accounts that can be modified by the owner, and that can
 * trigger specific functionality on the contract. These roles are:
 *  - transferrer (0): initiates token transfers between smart wallets by
      designating a recipient and transferring on behalf of the sender 
 *  - pauser (1): pauses any role (only the owner is then able to unpause it)
 *
 * When making transfers, the transferrer must adhere to two constraints:
 *  - it must provide "proof" that the recipient is a smart wallet by including
 *    the initial user signing key used to derive the smart wallet address
 *  - it must not attempt to transfer more Dai, or more than the Dai-equivalent
 *    value of Dharma Dai, than the current "limit" set by the owner.
 *
 * Smart wallet "proofs" can be validated via `isSmartWallet`.
