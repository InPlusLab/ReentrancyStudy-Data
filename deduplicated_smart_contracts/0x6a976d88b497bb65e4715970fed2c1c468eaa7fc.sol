// ******************************
//  Welcome to AddressWars Beta!
// ******************************
//
// This contract is currently in a state of being tested and bug hunted,
// as this is the beta, there will be no fees for enlisting or wagering.
// This will encourage anyone to come and try out AddressWars for free
// before deciding to play the live version (when released) as well as
// making it so that the contract is tested to the fullest ability before
// the live version is deployed. The website is currently under development
// and will be continually improved as time goes on, once the live version
// is deployed, you can access it's contract and data through the root url
// (https://addresswars.io/) and there will always be a copy of the website
// on a subdomain that you can visit in order to view and interact with this
// contract at any time in the future.
//
// This contract is pushing the limits of the current Ethereum blockchain as
// there are quite a lot of variables that it needs to keep track of as well
// as being able to handle the statistical generation of key numbers. As a
// result, the estimated gas cost to deploy this contract is 7.5M whereas
// the current block gas limit is only 8M so this contract will take up
// almost a whole block! Another problem with complex contracts is the fact
// that there is a 16 local variable limit per function and in a few cases,
// the functions needed access to a lot more than that so a lot of filtering
// functions have been developed to handle the calculation internally then
// simply return the useful parts.
//
//
// **************************
//  How to play AddressWars!
// **************************
//
// Enlisting
// In order to start playing AddressWars, you must first have an Ethereum
// wallet address which you can issue transactions from but only non-contract 
// addresses (ie addresses where you can issue a transaction directly) can play.
// From here, you can simply call the enlist() function and send the relevant
// fee (in the beta it's 0 ETH, for the live it will be 0.01 ETH). After the
// transaction succeeds, you will have your very own, randomly generated
// address card that you can now put up for wager or use to attempt to claim
// other address cards with!
//
// Wagering
// You can choose to wager any card you own assuming you are not already 
// wagering a copy of that card. For your own address, you can provide a
// maximum of 10 other copies to any other addresses (by either transferring 
// or wagering), once 10 copies of your own address are circulating, you will
// no longer be able to transfer or wager your own address (although you can
// still use it to claim other addresses). It is important to note that there
// is no way to 'destroy' a copy of a card in circulation and your own address
// card cannot be transferred back to you (and you can't attempt to claim your
// own address card).
// To wager a card, simply call the wagerCardForAmount() function and send
// the relevant fee (in the beta it's 0 ETH, for the live it will be 0.005 ETH)
// as well as the address of the card you wish to wager and the amount you are
// willing to wager it for (in wei). From this point, any other address can
// attempt to claim the address card you listed but the card that will be put up
// for claim will be the one with the lowest claim price (this may not be yours 
// at the time but as soon as a successful claim happens and you are the next
// cheapest price, the next time someone attempts to claim that address, you
// will receive the wager and your card may be claimed and taken from you).
//
// Claiming
// Assuming your address has already enlisted, you are free to attempt to
// claim any card that has a current wager on it. You can only store up to
// 8 unique card addresses (your own address + 7 others) in your inventory
// and you cannot claim if you are already at this limit (unless you already own
// that card). You can claim as many copies of a card you own as you like but you
// can only get rid of them by wagering off one at a time. As mentioned above,
// the claim contender will be the owner of the cheapest claim wager. You cannot 
// claim a card if you are the current claim contender or if the card address is 
// the same as your address (ie you enlisted and got that card).
// To attempt to claim, you need to first assemble an army of 3 address cards
// (these cards don't have to be unique but you do have to own them) and send the 
// current cheapest wager price to the attemptToClaimCard() function. This function  
// will do all of the calculation work for you and determine if you managed to claim
// the card or not. The first thing that happens is the contract randomly picks 
// your claim contenders cards ensuring that at least one of the cards is the card
// address you are attempting to claim and the rest are from their inventory.
// After this point, all of the complex maths happens and the final attack
// and defence numbers will be calculated based on all of the cards types,
// modifiers and the base attack and defence stats.
// From here it's simply a matter of determining how many hits got through
// on both claimer and claim contender, it's calculated as follows;
// opponentsHits = yourCard[attack] - opponentsCard[defence]
//  ^ will be 0 if opponentsCard[defence] > yourCard[attack]
// This is totalled up for both the claimer and the claim contender and the
// one with the least amount of hits wins!
//
// Claim Outcomes
// There are 3 situations that can result from a claim attempt;
// 1. The total hits for both the claimer and the claim contender are equal
//    - this means that you have drawn with your opponent, the wager will
//      then be distributed;
//      98% -> the claimer (you get most of the wager back)
//      2% -> the dev
// 2. The claimer has more hits than the claim contender
//    - this means that you have lost against your opponent as they ended
//      up taking less hits than you, the wager will then be distributed;
//      98% -> the claim contender (they get most of the wager)
//      2% -> the dev
// 3. The claimer has less hits than the claim contender
//    - this means that you have succeeded in claiming the card and hence
//      that card address will be transferred from the claim contender
//      to the claimer. in this case, both claimer and claim contender
//      receive a portion of the wager as follow;
//      50% -> the claimer (you get half of the wager back)
//      48% -> the claim contender (they get about half of the wager)
//      2% -> the dev
//
// Transferring
// You are free to transfer any card you own to another address that has
// already enlisted. Upon transfer, only one copy of the card will be removed
// from your inventory so if you have multiple copies of that card, it will
// not be completely removed from your inventory. If you only had one copy
// though, that address will be removed from your inventory and you will
// be able to claim/receive another address in its place.
// There are some restrictions when transferring a card; 
//   1. you cannot be currently wagering the card
//   2. the address you are transferring to must already be enlisted
//   3. the address you are transferring the card to must have less than 
//      8 unique cards already (or they must already own the card)
//   4. you cannot transfer a card back to it's original address
//   5. if you are gifting your own address card, the claim limit will apply
//      and if 10 copies already exist, you will not be able to gift your card.
//
// Withdrawing
// All ETH transferred to the contract will stay in there until an
// address wishes to withdraw from their account. Balances are tracked
// per address and you can either withdraw an amount (assuming you have
// a balance higher than that amount) or you can just withdraw it all.
// For both of these cases there will be no fees associated with withdrawing
// from the contract and after you choose to withdraw, your balance will
// update accordingly.
//
//
// Have fun and good luck claiming!
