//////// This is the official eUSD smart contract.
//// The eUSD token contract utilizes the eFIAT protocol - a not-for-profit,
//// fully transparent, publicly auditable protocol designed to migrate fiat
//// currencies to the Ethereum blockchain without banks, escrow accounts or reserves.

//// The eFIAT protocol relies on Proof of Burn, meaning any eUSD can only
//// be created by burning Ether at market value. Because Ether is denominated also
//// in USD value, the burning of Ether can be regarded as burning of US Dollars,
//// where Ether serves only as the medium of value transfer and verifiable proof
//// that actual value has ben permanently migrated and not replicated. This means
//// eUSD can never be used to redeem any Ether burned in the eUSD creation process!
