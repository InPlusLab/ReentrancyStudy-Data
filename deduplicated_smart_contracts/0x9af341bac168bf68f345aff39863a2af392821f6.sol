* Finally, a Community Funding Project for PoWTF!
*
* -> WTF is this!?
* In short, this is a contract to accept PoWTF token / ETH donations from community memebers
* as a way of gathering funds for regular marketing and contests.
* [✓] Hands of Stainless Steel! This tokens never sells, he can't and just simply don't know how to sell!
* [✓] Community Goods: All dividends will be used for promotional fee / contest prices, when the accumulated dividends get to certain amount, we'll create some campaign.
* [✓] Transparency: How to use the dividends will be regularly updated in website and discord announcement.
* [✓] Security: You need to trust me (@AppX Matthew) not to taking the dividends and go away :)
