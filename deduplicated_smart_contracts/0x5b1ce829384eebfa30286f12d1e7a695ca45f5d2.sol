 * @notice A proxy contract that uses delegatecall to execute function calls on a target contract using its own storage context.
 The target contract is a Manager contract that is registered with the Controller.
 * @dev Both this proxy contract and its target contract MUST inherit from ManagerProxyTarget in order to guarantee
 that both contracts have the same storage layout. Differing storage layouts in a proxy contract and target contract can
 potentially break the delegate proxy upgradeability mechanism. Since this proxy contract inherits from ManagerProxyTarget which inherits
 from Manager, it implements the setController() function. The target contract will also implement setController() since it also inherits
 from ManagerProxyTarget. Thus, any transaction sent to the proxy that calls setController() will execute against the proxy instead
 of the target. As a result, developers should keep in mind that the proxy will always execute the same logic for setController() regardless
 of the setController() implementation on the target contract. Generally, developers should not add any additional functions to this proxy contract
 because any function implemented on the proxy will always be executed against the proxy and the call **will not** be forwarded to the target contract
