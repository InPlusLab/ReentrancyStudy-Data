About us!

We are 6 developers in the NOBU team from all around the world, and our goal is to scale $NOBU into becoming a top dog token! We are going to try our utter best, to bring rapid results and clear checkmarks on our roadmap! Join us in our journey to make the greatest community at token in the crypto space.

Tokenomics:
1 000 000 000 tokens minted.
50% of the total supply burned and destroyed forever.
50% - 500 000 000 $NOBU tokens remain in circulation.

4% tax on each transaction. 2% is re distributed to all holders and 2% is burned forever. This means that you automatically get rewarded with more $NOBU tokens just by HODLing, AND the scarcity of our token increases with every transaction. Which means the value of our token increases for each transaction! A win win situation for everyone!

Allocations:
50% of the supply burned.
44.5% of the supply will go into Uniswap.
5% private sales for providing liquidity in the pool + dev team.
0.5% for marketing and audit (Techrate)

Short term goals:
1. Hotbit listing within first month
2. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listing within first week
3. Tiktok and Twitter influencers for marketing.
4. Contract audit by Techrate completed within first 2 weeks
