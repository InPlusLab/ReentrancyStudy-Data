/*
In all states except the Ending state:
    Anyone can contribute and receive tokens at a ratio of 1 token : 1 ETH.
    Contributors can burn their tokens to recall their contribution, but the recall is subject to a burn fee depending on contract stage.
    Contributors and the Producer can make statements
        Contributors can optionally burn tokens as part of the statement (as some interfaces may prioritize messages with high burns or ignore 0-burn messages).

The contract starts in the Inactive state.
In the Inactive state:
    Contributors can recall deposited funds with no burn fee.
    There is no project set.
    previewStageEndTime and roundEndTime are both ignored.
    The producer can call beginProject with proposalString, previewStageInterval, and activeInterval
        This moves the the contract to the Active state (Preview stage)

In the Active state:
    The producer is expected to make public progress on his proposal described in proposalString
    In the Preview stage:
        Contributors can recall their contributions, but 10% of the contribution is burned.
    After the Preview stage:
        Contributors can recall their contributions, but 50% of the contribution is burned.
    After activeInterval has passed, producer can call tryRoundEnd, triggering the Ending state.

Because mappings cannot be directly deleted, we must iterate through all contributors and reset each balance.
Due to gas limits, tryRoundEnd may have to be called several times to iterate over every contributor.
The purpose of the Ending state is to ensure this process is eventually completed safely.

In the Ending state:
    Most functions, including ERC223 functionality, is halted.
    Any user can make subsequent calls to tryRoundEnd.
    Each call to tryRoundEnd iterates further through the list of contributors and sets their balance to 0 (destroying the tokens)
    Once all balances have been reset:
        The producer receives the contract's remaining balance.
        The contract returns to the Inactive state.
