# Autoinvest in 3rd party campaigns

It should be possible to join auto investment into big ICOs even if they take place not on Blockstarter.

## Contributor

### Top up deposit on Blockstarter

Then it will be possible to use any amount of that money when participating in autoinvestment into campaigns that take place on other platforms.

* Submit your decision.

## BlockStarter

### How to manage autoinvesments

* Blockstarter accepts autoinvestment applications up until 3 days before 3rd party campaign starts.

* Blockstarter converts all funds to the currencies, that are accepted by 3rd party campaign. For example if campaign accepts Ethers only, but BS collected Bitcoins and Waves, it could be possible to convert all these to Ether and invest into campaign using Ethers.

* On the day when campaign starts, Blockstarter makes one big investment into 3rd party ICO.

# XBS token and economy of BlockStarter

XBS tokens could be used in different cases:

* Fee for usage of Blockstarter services: publish campaign, publish bounty, publish smart contract.

* Payment for mass feedback to fix conceptual bugs. 

* Payment for promotions of campaign, bounties, jobs and it’s position in the list.

* Payment for work made by contributor or employee.

* Reward for bounty in contrast to unissued tokens of a project.

* Payment for event posting on the Blockstarter related to the ICO to attract contributors.

## Fee for usage of Blockstarter services

Let’s assume that 1 XBS token = 1 USD.

* When creating a new campaign it is required to topup your Blockstarter balance to 500 tokens. 

* 50-100 tokens (10-20% of them) go to Blockstarter.

* 400 tokens left on startupper deposit. Startupper can use these tokens later to pay for work of other contributors: improve whitepaper, legal consultancy, artwork, etc.

* After all startupper will have 400 XBS tokens that could be used in different cases as we see below.

## Payment for promotions

Having big listing it’s always hard to be noticed naturally. Especially if you are unknown project.

XBS tokens can be used to pay for promotions of crowdsale campaigns and bounties.

Having hundreds to thousands of campaigns on site it will be hard to outstand.

By paying for, let’s say 1000 tokens will give a campaign 1000 extra views by showing the campaign on the top of Blockstarter site.

The similar situation could be with bounties or job entries: there could be thousands of different bounties and to get on top of other bounties, a project will pay some XBS tokens.

## Reward for bounty

It should be possible to pay for bounty with non existent tokens of any particular project that is going to launch crowdsale. This is a good way for project to save money and to get some work done for free. But from the other side this way of payment is not safe for workers/contributors, because there is a big chance that project will not success in crowdsale because of big competition between other projects.

XBS tokens as a payment reward for bounty could be a good alternative. Every project could have XBS tokens on its deposit (for example after a required topup during publishing of ICO campaign), and these tokens could be used as a reward for bounty tasks instead of unissued tokens of project. XBS tokens will be more respected and safe way to pay for the job, such as they will be tradeable at that moment in contrast to unissued tokens of a project. 

## Payment for work

XBS tokens could be used as a currency that projects will use to pay salary for their employees or as a one time payment to freelancers. What kind of work can be payed with XBS tokens?

* Improve/review whitepaper.

* Legal support / consultancy.

* Copywriting and PR.

* Programming related tasks.

* Design and artwork.

* Regular salary for employee.

* One time payment for freelancer.

## Fee from money raised during ICO

Blockstarter will take next % from money each campaign raise during ICO:

* 10% up to 1m USD.

* 5% from 1m to 10m USD.

* 2.5% from 10m USD.

# <<< START AFTER SUCCESSFUL ICO >>>

Public ICO is considered successful if Blockstarter raises more than 2,000,000 USD.
