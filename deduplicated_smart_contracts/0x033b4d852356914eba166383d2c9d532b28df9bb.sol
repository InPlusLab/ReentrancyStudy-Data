 *  @author Cl√©ment Lesaege - <clement@kleros.io>
 *  @dev A contract to allow the sale of tokens against ETH at a price decided by the seller.
 *  Note that this contract is kept as simple as possible.
 *  It is not optimized for handling a high amount of orders by the seller but to support 1-10 orders on average.
 *  If you intend to use a lot more simultaneous orders, we would suggest developing a heap-based version of this contract.
 *  Note that:
 *      - Orders are not automatically removed when they are completely fulfilled in order to avoid changing the orderID without intervention of the seller.
 *      - Tokens amounts and prices are supposed to be reasonable such that multiplying them does not overflow.
 *      - A few wei or basic token units may be lost in the process. Only use this contract to sell a token whose basic unit price is insignificant.
 *      - The token contract is trusted not to reenter during a call to this contract.
