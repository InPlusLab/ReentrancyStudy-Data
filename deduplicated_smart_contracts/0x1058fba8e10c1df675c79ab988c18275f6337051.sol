/*
   HolyWing is a middleware contract that acts as an abstraction layer for tokens exchange
   (ERC20 tokens and ETH)

   The current implementation is using 0x API for performing actual swap, as 0x is aiming for
   best execution, there's no complex logic for now regarding that.
   The contract is not intended to gather fees, be called by users, it is called by the HolyHand,
   which is aimed to do that. This contract is attached to a HolyHand, and has permission to
   create allowance for arbitrary token it would need access to.
   Both of HolyWing and HolyHand contracts do not hold funds, all operations are performed within
   single transaction.

   Exchange occurs in the following steps:
   1. This contract is provided with amount of tokens on its address directly by HolyHand
      (thus does not requiring any allowance calls)
   2. This contract is provided with data of how order is going to be routed (bytes swalCallData)
   3. 0x order routing may require that this contract should set allowance to some address to spend
      its tokens;
   4. The address that performs the swap is called with swapdata set;
   5. If swap is successful, this contract transfers tokens back to the HolyHand contract
      (as well as remaining ETH value if any fee refunds occur, etc.)
   6. Appropriate event is emitted with swap details;

/* HolyPool is a contract that holds user assets
   
   It can have attached strategy (HolyValor) that performs yield generating (investing) activities.
   It is non-custodiary. Any user should be able to withdraw his funds from this contract and, if needed,
   from the attached HolyValor contract without any interference.
   It holds a portion of actual user assets, and part of it is forming a hot reserve (is not invested)
   to provide faster and cheaper withdrawals on demand.
   HolyPool has a base currency (token) set, which is aimed to be USDC at the start of launching.
   Base currency is set during construction (and cannot be changed later to exclude possible malicious
   actions from the managing actors).

   NOTE: this contract doesn't contain function emergencyTransfer as many other HH contracts do, as it is
   actually holding customer funds, and no external access is allowed in any form over them except the user
   himself through defined call pipelines through proxy contract.

   NOTE: HolyPool does not provide any kind of LP/holder/staker token as a result of funds allocation.
   It just adds the appropriate user share amount of the assets in the pool upon deposit and removes
   when user withdraws using local mapping variable and total variable, this would also help to make
   gas cheaper without additional token transfers.

   The only functions that move funds in the pool are
   - depositOnBehalf -- callable only by transfer proxy
   - withdraw -- callable only by transfer proxy
   - borrowToInvest -- provide a portion of funds to be allocated by invest proxy
   - returnInvested -- return invested funds (could be divest or getting received yield) by invest proxy only

   If no conversion is needed, the route of deposit flow
     user USDC -> HolyHand -> HolyPool
   should be kept very minimal to keep gas costs low (same for withdrawal if HolyPool has enough immediate liquidity).

   NOTE: Pool does not perform any exchange, all operations are in baseAsset token
