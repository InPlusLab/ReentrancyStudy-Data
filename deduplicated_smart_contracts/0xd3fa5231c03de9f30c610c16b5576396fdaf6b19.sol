* [x] If  you are reading this it means you have been FOMO'd
* [x] It looks like an exploit in the way ERC20 is indexed on Etherscan allows malicious users to virally advertise by deploying contracts that look like this.
* [x] You pretty much own this token forever, with nothing you can do about it until we pull the UNFOMO() function.
