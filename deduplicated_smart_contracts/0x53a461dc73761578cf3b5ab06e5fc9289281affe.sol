 * The vote can be performed for a certain amount of time (expressed in block).
 * To vote you need to approve the token transfer first.

 * Once you voted you cannot redeem your tokens until the end of the voting period.
 * You can vote several times and with different tokens. You can redeem all of them in just one shot.
