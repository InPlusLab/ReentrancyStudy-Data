*   ---About the Project

*  Blockchain-enabled smart contracts have opened a new era of trustless relationships without 

*  intermediaries. This technology opens incredible financial possibilities. Our automated investment 

*  distribution model is written into a smart contract, uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain and can be 

*  freely accessed online. In order to insure our investors' complete security, full control over the 

*  project has been transferred from the organizers to the smart contract: nobody can influence the 

*  system's permanent autonomous functioning.

* 

* ---How to use:

*  1. Send from ETH wallet to the smart contract address 0x311f71389e3DE68f7B2097Ad02c6aD7B2dDE4C71

*     any amount from 0.01 ETH.

*  2. Verify your transaction in the history of your application or etherscan.io, specifying the address 

*     of your wallet.

*  3a. Claim your profit by sending 0 ether transaction (every 10 min, every day, every week, i don't care unless you're 

*      spending too much on GAS)

*  OR

*  3b. For reinvest, you need to deposit the amount that you want to reinvest and the 

*      accrued interest automatically summed to your new contribution.

*  

* RECOMMENDED GAS LIMIT: 200000

* RECOMMENDED GAS PRICE: https://ethgasstation.info/

* You can check the payments on the etherscan.io site, in the "Internal Txns" tab of your wallet.

*

* ---Refferral system:

*     from 0 to 10.000 ethers in the fund - remuneration to each contributor is 3.33%, 

*     from 10.000 to 100.000 ethers in the fund - remuneration will be 2%, 

*     from 100.000 ethers in the fund - each contributor will get 1%.

*

* ---It is not allowed to transfer from exchanges, only from your personal ETH wallet, for which you 

* have private keys.

* 

* Contracts reviewed and approved by pros!

* 

* Main contract - Revolution2. Scroll down to find it.
