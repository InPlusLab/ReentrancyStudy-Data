/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @title   Passive Strategy
 * @notice  Rebalancing strategy for Alpha Vault that maintains the two
 *          following range orders:
 *
 *          1. Base order is placed between X - B and X + B + TS.
 *          2. Limit order is placed between X - L and X, or between X + TS
 *             and X + L + TS, depending on which token it holds more of.
 *
 *          where:
 *
 *              X = current tick rounded down to multiple of tick spacing
 *              TS = tick spacing
 *              B = base threshold
 *              L = limit threshold
 *
 *          Note that after these two orders, the vault should have deposited
 *          all its tokens and should only have a few wei left.
 *
 *          Because the limit order tries to sell whichever token the vault
 *          holds more of, the vault's holdings will have a tendency to get
 *          closer to a 1:1 balance. This enables it to continue providing
 *          liquidity without running out of inventory of either token, and
 *          achieves this without the need to swap directly on Uniswap and pay
 *          fees.
