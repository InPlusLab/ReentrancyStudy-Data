/*  ChiMarket is a contract that allows for buying and selling of CHI tokens for
    used in the Aethia game (see https://aethia.co). The contract is designed to
    discover the price of CHI (in ETH) through market forces (i.e. supply and
    demand). The contract dynamically determines the price for each trade such that
    the value of ETH and the value of CHI held by the contract are always the same.
    
    This mechanism guarantees that you can always buy and sell any amount of CHI,
    although the price might be outrageously high or low, depending on the amount
    you are trying to buy/sell.
    
    The contract provides to functions that can be used to query how much ETH
    the contract is willing to pay for your CHI, or how much ETH you&#39;ll need to 
    buy CHI. You can call those functions without generating a transaction,
    for example in the "Read Smart Contract" tab on Etherscan. This will give 
    you an estimate only, because the price might change by the time your TX confirms. 
    To avoid price surprises, this contract only supports limit buy and sells.
    
    Limit buy and sell functions are used to convert CHI/ETH into ETH/CHI. limitSell
    also takes a limit argument, which is the lowest amount of ETH you are willing
    to accept for your trade. On the buy side, you should send more ETH than rrequired
    to provide a cushin. You will always get the exact current price, the 
    limit argument is just to provide safety in case price changes dramatically.
    If you send extra ETH, the excess will be returned to you in the same TX.
