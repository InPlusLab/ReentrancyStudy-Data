/*
* The "Become a Billionaire" decentralized Raffle v1.0, Main-Net Release.
* ~by Gluedog 
* -----------
* 
* Compiler version: 0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05.Emscripten.clang
* 
* The weekly Become a Billionaire decentralized raffle is the basis of the deflationary mechanism for Billionaire Token
* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Every week, users can register 10 XBL to an Ethereum Smart Contract address – this is the equivalent of buying one ticket,
*     more tickets mean a better chance to win. Users can buy an unlimited number of tickets to increase their chances.
*     At the end of the week, the Smart Contract will choose three winners at random. First place will get 40% of
*     the tokens  that were raised during that week, second place gets 20% and third place gets 10%.
*     From the remaining 30% of the tokens: 10% are burned – as an offering to the market gods. The other 20% are sent
*     to another Smart Contract Address that works like a twisted faucet – rewarding people for burning their own coins.
* 
* The Become a Billionaire raffle Smart Contract will run forever, and will have an internal timer that will reset
*     itself every seven days or after there have been 256 tickets registered to the Raffle. The players are registered
*     by creating an internal mapping, inside the Smart Contract, a mapping of every address that registers tokens to 
*     it and their associated number of tickets. This mapping is reset every time the internal timer resets (every seven days).
